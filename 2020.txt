on Consent Board Member Resolutions for Action Ms Suavillo Ms Garca Celebrating Filipino Heritage and History Month Res Noticed December Whereas Filipinos contributed to the progression of the cultural intellectual political and economic life in the United States and the Los Angeles Unified School District Whereas There is an estimated million FilipinoAmericans residing in the United States making them the second largest AsianAmerican population within the country Whereas The Historic Filipinotown HiFi is located in Los Angeles Whereas percent of District students identify as Filipino Whereas In October the first Filipinos arrived in the United States in what is now Morro Bay California Whereas October is the birth month of influential FilipinoAmerican labor leader Larry Itlong Whereas October was declared Filipino Heritage Month in California and Hawaii in and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas The California Department of Education officially recognized October as Filipino Heritage Month in now therefore be it Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District will declare October as Filipino Heritage and History Month starting October of the school year and onward Resolved further That the Superintendent be directed to explore establishing one or more Dual Language Education Programs with the target language being Filipino and any of the major Filipino dialects ie Tagalog within the District to address the language needs of Filipino speaking students and provide ample opportunities for students to explore the historical and cultural aspects of the FilipinoAmerican community and of the Philippines and be it finally Resolved That the District will work with all schools to accurately represent and celebrate the Filipino history and heritage Dr McKenna Mr Schmerelson Ms Goldberg TobaccoFree and VapingFree Schools and Communities Res Noticed December and Discussed at December Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to providing a healthy environment for all students and staff to ensure that the physical behavioral social emotional and mental health needs of students are met Whereas The District through our mission statement will be a progressive global leader in education providing a dynamic and inspiring learning experience where all students graduate ready for success Whereas The District also enjoys a robust partnership with LA Trust for Childrens Health whose mission of student health is directly related to student academic success Whereas District educators and health professionals recognize the importance of tobacco use prevention education in order to reduce tobaccorelated illnesses and understand the best way to prevent tobaccorelated illnesses is to keep youth from starting to smoke or use tobacco products Whereas The District works with Los Angeles County Office of Education Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and other partnering public agencies to promote good health by discouraging tobacco use through the participation of District students in local Tobacco Use Prevention Education TUPE efforts Whereas Marketing by the tobacco industry has now targeted young people with packaging and names that appeal to youth as well as tobacco products that mask the harsh taste and odor of tobacco with flavors highly appealing to youth eg bubble gum cotton candy grape gummy bear chocolate chip cookie Whereas Tobacco companies and retailers profit from the researchproven fact that the earlier a person starts to use tobacco the harder it will become for them to quit Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Tobacco companies have historically targeted communities of color with aggressive marketing of mentholated tobacco products resulting in disproportionate rates of tobaccorelated disease and death eg of Black youth smokers of Asian youth smokers and of Latino youth smokers report use of mentholflavored cigarettes Whereas According to the US Surgeon General ecigarettes and other electronic nicotine devices ENDS contain nicotine which is a highly addictive drug that has immediate biochemical effects on the brain and body alters adolescent brain development and is toxic in high doses Whereas Ecigarettes and other ENDS were found to be harmful to youth and other individuals by the United States Court of Appeals and organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics American Lung Association and American Heart Association support the regulation of ecigarettes and other ENDS and Whereas The District recognizes that ensuring the health of children is a communitywide commitment now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District in keeping with California Education Code will take all practical and necessary steps to discourage students from smoking including forbidding the use of tobacco products and vaping devices on campuses and during any schoolrelated activities and by providing student education and family information on the dangers of tobacco and vaping use Resolved further That the District call on our entire community of local civic and elected leaders to join in support of ensuring student health by refraining from the marketing and sales of tobacco flavored tobacco and vaping products to young people throughout the City of Los Angeles and the neighboring cities served by the District and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent directs staff to strongly support any and all civic social service and government agencies in their legislative efforts and campaigns that protect the health of an entire generation by preventing them from becoming exposed and potentially addicted to nicotine or other harmful substances in tobacco and vaping products Ms Goldberg Directing Charter School Overallocation Reimbursement Funds to Home Schools Res Noticed December and Discussed at December Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District recently began collecting charter schools mandatory reimbursement obligation funds for the overallocation of Proposition space resulting from charter schools failures to generate the indistrict classroom average daily attendance that the charter schools projected for the applicable school year and Whereas District schools who host charter school colocations Home School are often limited in their use of school facilities such as auditoriums gyms libraries computer labs space for itinerant teachers and other room space now therefore be it Resolved That all overallocation reimbursement funds collected from a charter school shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was colocated Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved further That any charter school overallocation reimbursement funds that have already been collected by the District shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was colocated and be it finally Resolved That the Home Schools Local School Leadership Council or School Site Council shall have the authority to decide how these overallocation reimbursement funds shall be spent for the benefit of the Home School Ms Gonez SOMOS LAUSD Declaring Los Angeles Unified School Districts Opposition to Migrant Youth Detention Facilities in Our Communities Res Waiver of Board Rule Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves an incredibly diverse population of over students and their families including languages spoken and over different nationalities Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has repeatedly affirmed its support for our immigrant students and families and the assets they bring to our schools including through Demanding Action on DREAMs Deferred Finding a Permanent Resolution for Undocumented Youth and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries Res Putting Kids First Means Keeping Families Together Res Declaring March as Immigrant Student Family and District Staff Month Res and Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement Res Whereas The We Are One LA Unified campaign was created to affirm that our schools are safe and welcoming places for immigrant families and to provide resources to help ensure their success including particular supports for undocumented students and students from mixedstatus families Whereas The District welcomed approximately newcomer students in the school year and will serve approximately newcomers in the school year ensuring they are provided the additional supports they need to be successful in school college career and life Whereas All children regardless of their immigration status are afforded certain unalienable rights under the US Constitution including the right to access a free public education Plyler v Doe Whereas Due to the actions of the federal government under the Trump Administration nearly migrant children were held in government custody in an increase of percent compared to the previous year Associated Press Whereas The median length of detention for children is days more than five months and some children have been in detention as long as a year and children have systematically been separated from their families causing potential longlasting detrimental effects according to the American Academy of Pediatrics March Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas The United States is the only country in the United Nations body to have not ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child September and The United Nations Human Rights Office reported that the Trump administrations current zero tolerance practice of family separation amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life and is a serious violation of the rights of the child June Whereas VisionQuest a forprofit private corporation with a history of allegations of mistreatment of detained children dating back to the s Newsweek November has petitioned the City of Los Angeles to approve the development of a facility in Arleta in the East San Fernando Valley to house detained unaccompanied minors facing immigration proceedings and Whereas The detention of migrant children has no place in the communities of Los Angeles now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District categorically opposes VisionQuests proposal to open and operate a migrant youth detention center in Arleta as well as any other immigrant youth detention center within the Districts attendance boundaries as it is antithetical to the Districts core purpose of creating safe spaces for learning where student diversity is celebrated and an inherent part of achieving a st century education and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to formally share the Districts categorical opposition to VisionQuests proposal PARCM with the City of Los Angeles City Clerks Office and Los Angeles Planning and Zoning Department Board Member Resolutions Referred for Discussion Mr Melvoin Ms Garca Ms Goldberg Increasing Equitable Access to Student Health Care Res Noticed November and Referred to Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District exists to provide every child in Los Angeles with a highquality education and believes that the educational success of a child should never be dictated or hindered by inequitable access to basic health services including vision and dental care Whereas The lived experience of our most vulnerable students demonstrates the reality of these critical inequities and the grave impact that an untreated toothache or inability to see the board in class can have on a students ability to learn Whereas While various efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually there is still a large unmet need as percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since Whereas The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administrations cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions this may include the District despite the Districts wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District Whereas California Senate Bill SB signed into law in helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites stating that if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment Whereas This law permits optout consent for oral health assessments which are typically more invasive than eye exams and the potential outfitting of glasses Whereas The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their childrens medical care while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary followup care with the proper health professionals we can do more to ensure that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses and Whereas School districts in California such as Compton Unified Inglewood Unified Pasadena Unified Lawndale Elementary Lennox School District Lynwood Unified Paramount Unified New Haven Unified San Leandro Unified Natomas Unified Alum Rock Unified Redwood City Monterey Peninsula Unified Mountain ViewWhisman School District and Newark Unified have all implemented successful optout consent programs for student eye exams now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and implement an optout consent program effective January wherein more students can have access to nocost vision and dental exams by health professionals Board Member Resolutions for Initial Announcement Ms Goldberg SENI Refining the Student Equity Needs Index Based on Multiple Measures Providing Increased Funding for Concentrations of Qualifying Students with an Index and Funding Formula that Prioritize Equity Transparency and Stability Res Whereas The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF mechanism permits school districts to determine locally how to distribute the LCFF SupplementalConcentration SC grants to increase or improve services for the Targeted Student Population TSP enrollments Lower Income English Learner and Foster Youth students who qualify each district to receive these funds and whereas the Los Angeles Unified School District since the advent of LCFF has distributed a portion of the SC grants as Discretionary TSP funds to individual school sites based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved

Communities Funding Act of Res Whereas For four decades school districts in California have experienced underinvestment and devastating cuts causing Californias school funding to fall behind and resulting in fewer services and resources for students and teachers Whereas The lack of adequate local funding is the result of an inequitable tax system in which corporations and wealthy investors do not pay their fair share in property taxes Whereas Loopholes in Californias property tax system allows a fraction of major commercial and industrial properties to avoid regular reassessment and use shady schemes to hide change in ownership Whereas These loopholes and tax schemes result in millions of dollars going to corporations and wealthy investors rather than to schools and local communities for essential services Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Experts estimate that the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act reclaims billion in property tax revenue every year to ensure that our schools and communities have the resources to educate all of our kids and the services to support all of our families Whereas The California Schools and Local

disabilities in the school year an percent increase from Whereas The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states local school districts and taxpayers to pay for needed services and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from Whereas In the school year the District spent over billion in special education costs with federal IDEA funding only reaching million accounting for just percent of the Districts expenditures woefully short of Congress commitment upon IDEAs passage to percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities Whereas According to the California Legislative Analysts Office local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability

of the major Filipino dialects ie Tagalog within the District to address the language needs of Filipino speaking students and provide ample opportunities for students to explore the historical and cultural aspects of the FilipinoAmerican community and of the Philippines and be it finally Resolved That the District will work with all schools to accurately represent and celebrate the Filipino history and heritage Dr McKenna Mr Schmerelson Ms Goldberg TobaccoFree and VapingFree Schools and Communities Res Noticed December and Discussed at December Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to providing a healthy environment for all students and staff to ensure that the physical behavioral social emotional and mental health needs of students are met Whereas The District through our mission statement will be a progressive global leader in education providing a dynamic and inspiring learning experience where all students graduate ready for success Whereas The District also enjoys a robust partnership with LA Trust for Childrens Health whose mission of student health is directly related to student academic success Whereas District educators and health professionals recognize the importance of tobacco use prevention education in order to reduce tobaccorelated illnesses and understand the best way to prevent tobaccorelated illnesses is to keep youth from starting to smoke or use tobacco products Whereas The District works with Los Angeles County Office of Education Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and other partnering public agencies to promote good health by discouraging tobacco use through the participation of District students in local Tobacco Use Prevention Education TUPE efforts Whereas Marketing by the tobacco industry has now targeted young people with packaging and names that appeal to youth as well as tobacco products that mask the harsh taste and odor of tobacco with flavors highly appealing to youth eg bubble gum cotton candy grape gummy bear chocolate chip cookie Whereas Tobacco companies and retailers profit from the researchproven fact that the earlier a person starts to use tobacco the harder it will become for them to quit Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Tobacco companies have historically targeted communities of color with aggressive marketing of mentholated tobacco products resulting in disproportionate rates of tobaccorelated disease and death eg of Black youth smokers of Asian youth smokers and of Latino youth smokers report use of mentholflavored cigarettes Whereas According to the US Surgeon General ecigarettes and other electronic nicotine devices ENDS contain nicotine which is a highly addictive drug that has immediate biochemical effects on the brain and body alters adolescent brain development and is toxic in high doses Whereas Ecigarettes and other ENDS were found to be harmful to youth and other individuals by the United States Court of Appeals and organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics American Lung Association and American Heart Association support the regulation of ecigarettes and other ENDS and Whereas The District recognizes that ensuring the health of children is a communitywide commitment now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District in keeping with California Education Code will take all practical and necessary steps to discourage students from smoking including forbidding the use of tobacco products and vaping devices on campuses and during any schoolrelated activities and by providing student education and family information on the dangers of tobacco and vaping use Resolved further That the District call on our entire community of local civic and elected leaders to join in support of ensuring student health by refraining from the marketing and sales of tobacco flavored tobacco and vaping products to young people throughout the City of Los Angeles and the neighboring cities served by the District and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent directs staff to strongly support any and all civic social service and government agencies in their legislative efforts and campaigns that protect the health of an entire generation by preventing them from becoming exposed and potentially addicted to nicotine or other harmful substances in tobacco and vaping products Ms Goldberg Directing Charter School Overallocation Reimbursement Funds to Home Schools Res Noticed December and Discussed at December Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District recently began collecting charter schools mandatory reimbursement obligation funds for the overallocation of Proposition space resulting from charter schools failures to generate the indistrict classroom average daily attendance that the charter schools projected for the applicable school year and Whereas District schools who host charter school colocations Home School are often limited in their use of school facilities such as auditoriums gyms libraries computer labs space for itinerant teachers and other room space now therefore be it Resolved That all overallocation reimbursement funds collected from a charter school shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was colocated Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved further That any charter school overallocation reimbursement funds that have already been collected by the District shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was colocated and be it finally Resolved That the Home Schools Local School Leadership Council or School Site Council shall have the authority to decide how these overallocation reimbursement funds shall be spent for the benefit of the Home School Ms Gonez SOMOS LAUSD Declaring Los Angeles Unified School Districts Opposition to Migrant Youth Detention Facilities in Our Communities Res Waiver of Board Rule Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves an incredibly diverse population of over students and their families including languages spoken and over different nationalities Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has repeatedly affirmed its support for our immigrant students and families and the assets they bring to our schools including through Demanding Action on DREAMs Deferred Finding a Permanent Resolution for Undocumented Youth and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries Res Putting Kids First Means Keeping Families Together Res Declaring March as Immigrant Student Family and District Staff Month Res and Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement Res Whereas The We Are One LA Unified campaign was created to affirm that our schools are safe and welcoming places for immigrant families and to provide resources to help ensure their success including particular supports for undocumented students and students from mixedstatus families Whereas The District welcomed approximately newcomer students in the school year and will serve approximately newcomers in the school year ensuring they are provided the additional supports they need to be successful in school college career and life Whereas All children regardless of their immigration status are afforded certain unalienable rights under the US Constitution including the right to access a free public education Plyler v Doe Whereas Due to the actions of the federal government under the Trump Administration nearly migrant children were held in government custody in an increase of percent compared to the previous year Associated Press Whereas The median length of detention for children is days more than five months and some children have been in detention as long as a year and children have systematically been separated from their families causing potential longlasting detrimental effects according to the American Academy of Pediatrics March Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas The United States is the only country in the United Nations body to have not ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child September and The United Nations Human Rights Office reported that the Trump administrations current zero tolerance practice of family separation amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life and is a serious violation of the rights of the child June Whereas VisionQuest a forprofit private corporation with a history of allegations of mistreatment of detained children dating back to the s Newsweek November has petitioned the City of Los Angeles to approve the development of a facility in Arleta in the East San Fernando Valley to house detained unaccompanied minors facing immigration proceedings and Whereas The detention of migrant children has no place in the communities of Los Angeles now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District categorically opposes VisionQuests proposal to open and operate a migrant youth detention center in Arleta as well as any other immigrant youth detention center within the Districts attendance boundaries as it is antithetical to the Districts core purpose of creating safe spaces for learning where student diversity is celebrated and an inherent part of achieving a st century education and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to formally share the Districts categorical opposition to VisionQuests proposal PARCM with the City of Los Angeles City Clerks Office and Los Angeles Planning and Zoning Department Board Member Resolutions Referred for Discussion Mr Melvoin Ms Garca Ms Goldberg Increasing Equitable Access to Student Health Care Res Noticed November and Referred to Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District exists to provide every child in Los Angeles with a highquality education and believes that the educational success of a child should never be dictated or hindered by inequitable access to basic health services including vision and dental care Whereas The lived experience of our most vulnerable students demonstrates the reality of these critical inequities and the grave impact that an untreated toothache or inability to see the board in class can have on a students ability to learn Whereas While various efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually there is still a large unmet need as percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since Whereas The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administrations cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions this may include the District despite the Districts wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District Whereas California Senate Bill SB signed into law in helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites stating that if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment Whereas This law permits optout consent for oral health assessments which are typically more invasive than eye exams and the potential outfitting of glasses Whereas The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their childrens medical care while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary followup care with the proper health professionals we can do more to ensure that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses and Whereas School districts in California such as Compton Unified Inglewood Unified Pasadena Unified Lawndale Elementary Lennox School District Lynwood Unified Paramount Unified New Haven Unified San Leandro Unified Natomas Unified Alum Rock Unified Redwood City Monterey Peninsula Unified Mountain ViewWhisman School District and Newark Unified have all implemented successful optout consent programs for student eye exams now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and implement an optout consent program effective January wherein more students can have access to nocost vision and dental exams by health professionals Board Member Resolutions for Initial Announcement Ms Goldberg SENI Refining the Student Equity Needs Index Based on Multiple Measures Providing Increased Funding for Concentrations of Qualifying Students with an Index and Funding Formula that Prioritize Equity Transparency and Stability Res Whereas The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF mechanism permits school districts to determine locally how to distribute the LCFF SupplementalConcentration SC grants to increase or improve services for the Targeted Student Population TSP enrollments Lower Income English Learner and Foster Youth students who qualify each district to receive these funds and whereas the Los Angeles Unified School District since the advent of LCFF has distributed a portion of the SC grants as Discretionary TSP funds to individual school sites based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved further That the total cost of positions necessary to the basic operation of a school whether from Base or SC funds shall continue to be centrally funded and not deducted from schoolsite discretionary allocations currently distributed under codes and and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent and District staff will report back within days on the three year enterprise plan to increase revenue to support the educational needs of students in all District schools as called for in Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna

share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities Whereas The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance AB providing Special Education Local Plan Areas SELPAs funding based on their overall student attendance regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide and Whereas The District proudly operates Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual students unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with moderate to severe disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with moderate to severe disabilities Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved further That the District formally recognizes December nd as Annual Special Education Day and encourages all schools and students to celebrate the diversity of their peers with disabilities Resolved further That the Board commits to

such as increasing Californias AB apportionments to meet the increases in special education costs Congress passing the IDEA Full Funding Act HR and Funding Early Childhood is the Right IDEA Act HR Resolved further That the Superintendent is directed to develop an advocacy strategy at both the state and federal level that is inclusive of families and educators of students with disabilities in

Woocher LLP Theodora Oringher PC Tobin Lucks LLP Vanderford and Ruiz LLP Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January the District has nearly expended the Boardauthorized capacity for the bench As the term of this bench does not end for a few more years the Division of Instruction is requesting approval to increase the Board authorized amount by five million dollars Why is this necessary To meet the goal of equitable college access for all students there is a need for sustained flexible support for youth who might otherwise not graduate or seriously consider attending college This is particularly the case because many District students represent the first generation of their families with the opportunity to attend college Early guidance and support for students and their parents can greatly ease the internal and external barriers to college attendance and enhance confidence in a students capacity to prepare for and acquire a college education With the inherent complexity and confusion of the college and financial aid application processes programs that build college knowledge fostering supportive personnel who build relationships and help students and their families prepare for change can be an essential element of making a successful transition from high school to postsecondary opportunities Why do we need to do this now With the unexpected collapse of Youth Policy Institute Bright Star Schools is attempting to make LA Unifieds GEAR UP LA the fiscal agent of their GEAR UP grant pending US Department of Educations approval This is a million dollar grant that serves school sites over a six year period The District has already exhausted the authorized expenditure of the current bench for college access and parent support services contracts In order to meet the needs of students the Division of Instruction is requesting an increase of five million dollars The approval of the increase the amount on the bench contract will enable schools and offices to continue to engage college readiness and parent support services The Districts priority is to increase graduation rates college and career readiness as well as increased opportunities to attend and complete college degrees What would happen if this were not approved Without an approved increase the District will be unable to provide our students continued access to the quality of the services that the Request for Proposals contracts provide Without the scale of Districtwide bench contract pricing any contracted services are likely to be more expensive and schools and offices would need to compete bids every time they wanted to access services What are the terms of the proposed agreement All renewal options for this bench of contracts have now been exercised All services materials and prices will be detailed in a summary catalogue so that the range of choices is readily available apparent to principals and administrators Once a service provider is selected a school or office will issue a shopping cart requisitions that will generate a purchase order to the vendor Ongoing evaluations of the providers will result in shared information that will enable access to the highest rate of service Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January If you have any questions or require additional information please contact me at carolalexanderlausdnet or at c

limited in scope or will expire soon By using cooperative contracts issued by a public agency the District benefits from competitivelybid public contracts These contracts will also ensure consistent pricing resulting in lower overall cost for the District What would happen if this were not approved LAUSD will likely pay higher prices for the vehicle and equipment parts and those parts may not be covered by warranty language that is included in the cooperative contracts In some cases without a contract TSD will not be able to procure the required parts and services What are the terms of the

Boardapproved FSDSEP Board Options and Consequences The Board can approve all actions presented or postpone selected actions pending receipt of additional information Nonratification of actions

Beautification Team January Facilities Services Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Board of Education Board approves entering into a Memorandum of Understanding MOU between the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD and Hollywood Beautification Team dba Los Angeles Beautification Team LABT Staff further proposes that the Board authorize the Chief Facilities Executive andor their designees to execute all instruments necessary as legally permissible to implement the MOU Background LAUSD seeks to help ensure its school sites benefit from the positive environmental impact of planting trees within their campuses Recognizing that trees help reduce greenhouse gases provide shade reduce the heat island effect and improve the school environment LAUSD seeks to enter into partnerships that will allow nonprofit organizations the ability to install new or replacement trees This MOU will allow LABT to provide programmatic and monetary resources if and when available to support the planting and caring for trees at LAUSD campuses The tree planting program consists of three primary programmatic strategies LABT acquiring trees through grant opportunities donations etc LABT providing materials and volunteers to plant trees on campuses throughout the District and LABT providing followup and support for the first year While all LAUSD school sites are eligible to receive new or replacement trees the geographic areas of the recipient school sites will be based on the conditions imposed by external funding sources such as grant programs that provide funding for projects located within defined geographic boundaries LABT will coordinate with LAUSD Facilities staff to identify potential school sites for planting of Districtapproved tree species on these campuses LABT and LAUSD will seek to achieve equitable distribution of new trees throughout the District as funds for these efforts are identified Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board will approve entering into this MOU to permit the District and LABT to begin planning activities and identifying school sites for the installation of District approved trees as funding becomes available via grants and other external funding sources Board Options and Consequences Approval of this action will allow staff to begin working with LABT to select school sites and tree installation locations on campuses Approval will also allow LABT to install trees at schools at LAUSD approved locations that will help green those campuses combat greenhouse gases improve air quality and improve the overall campus environments If the proposed action is not approved this tree planting program will not move forward Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Policy Implications The requested action does not change current District policies Budget Impact The proposed action does not require additional District funding Under this MOU installation of trees will be funded by grants or other external funding sources LABT will subject to funding availability pay for all programmatic activities performed including care and support of newly installed trees for the first year and the District will maintain the trees in accordance with and to the degree permitted by its annual Maintenance Operations MO budget Staff time and activities associated with administering the MOU will be funded by MO General Funds using existing staff Student Impact Students attending selected schools that meet the conditions of LABT acquired grants or other external funds will benefit from these new trees that will help create new canopy cover increase campus greening and mitigate local pollution The proposed installation of new trees will contribute to a reduction in harmful greenhouse gas emissions reduce urban heat island effect and improve local air quality for students Issues and Analysis The District understands the importance of providing green spaces on our campuses for student and teacher health and as a means to encourage ecological health for the region The installation of new trees under the proposed MOU helps establish and maintain healthy and vibrant school campuses As limited funding continues to be a challenge the MOU allows the District to increase green spaces through a partnership at no additional cost to the District In keeping with the terms of the MOU LABT must coordinate with LAUSD Facilities staff before the selection of any recipient school sites and gain District approval before scheduling tree planting activities LABT must follow District protocol guidelines specifications and provide all required District permits signed waivers and insurance as applicable This MOU

of Intention to Dedicate an Easement at Para Los Ninos Evelyn Thurman Gratts Primary Center Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center as legally described in Exhibit A and shown on Exhibit B attached to the City of Los Angeles City a municipal corporation copies of which are on file and available for public examination in the Board Secretariats Office South Beaudry Avenue th Floor Los Angeles California Furthermore staff proposes that the Board authorize the Chief Facilities Executive andor his designees to execute an easement agreement associated with the dedication of easement Property A portion of Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center See Exhibits A and B South Hartford Avenue Los Angeles CA Purpose Dedication of easement over the widened public alley Grantee City of Los Angeles Consideration None Date of Public Hearing February Background On February the Board approved the Gratts Primary Center and Early Education Center project Project Board Report No In June Staff applied to the City to vacate a portion of the alley adjacent to the school site for the construction of the Project As a condition of the proposed alley vacation application Los Angeles Unified was required to construct and dedicate to the City a new access to the existing alley from Lucas Avenue In March the Board authorized the dedication of an easement over the new alley access to the City The alley access easement was recorded on April The initial Los Angeles Unified alley vacation application expired prior to completion but was readopted by the Los Angeles City Council on March During the reevaluation of the current Los Angeles Unified alley vacation application the City determined that it failed to previously require a foot wide strip on the northern end of the public alley be dedicated to align with the width of the alley as eventually constructed To correct this oversight the City requires Los Angeles Unified to dedicate a foot wide easement over the completed alley as shown on Exhibit B The dedication of the proposed easement is necessary to satisfy the remaining conditions of the alley vacation application and ensure the Citys responsibility to maintain and repair the entire public alley Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version California Education Code sections through specify that a Notice of Adoption of Resolution of Intention to Dedicate an Easement include a time not less than ten days after adoption of the Resolution to hold a public hearing by the Board The adopted Resolution must be posted in three public places within the Districts boundaries no less than days before the date of the public hearing and be published no less than five days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the Districts boundaries The Los Angeles Daily Journal is currently being used for this purpose Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center is located within the boundaries of Local District Central and Board District Mnica Garca Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates the Board will adopt the Resolution of Intention to Dedicate an Easement at Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center and authorize the Chief Facilities Executive andor his designees to execute an easement agreement associated with the dedication Board Options and Consequences If approved staff will proceed with the steps necessary to dedicate the easement to the City After dedication of the easement the City will be responsible for the maintenance and repair of improvements within the alley easement If the Board does not adopt the Resolution of Intention to Dedicate an Easement at Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center to the City Los Angeles Unified will not be able to fulfill all requirements for the proposed alley vacation application at Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center Policy Implications None Budget Impact All costs associated with the Resolution of Intention to Dedicate an Easement at Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center are included in the Project budget and funded from Bond Program funds Student Impact The dedication of an easement at Gratts Primary Center and Gratts Early Education Center ensure that the students attending the school are provided with safe and equal access to the campuses Issues and Analysis The City will continue to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the entire public alley Attachments Exhibit A Legal

Version Material Decrease in Attendance and Emergency Closure of District Schools and Centers due to Wildfires and a Gas Leak in October Request for Allowance of Attendance Due to an Emergency Condition Payment of Employees January Office of the Chief Financial Officer Action Proposed The Board of Education finds that the emergency closure of the District schools listed in Attachment A which includes K schools affiliated charter schools Division of Adult and Career Education DACE schools and Early Childhood Education Programs was necessary due to emergency conditions The Board of Education authorizes staff to take all necessary actions to obtain allowance of attendance from the California Department of Education CDE for the emergency closures as well as for the material decrease in attendance that schools may have experienced due to the emergency conditions as permitted by Education Code section The waiver application for emergency closure and material decrease in attendance may be sent to CDE at different times due to data gathering requirements The Board of Education ratifies payment of salaries for staff who were unable to report for duty due to emergency school closures road closures or evacuations as applicable for October and The Board of Education confirms the closure of the schools listed in Attachment A Background In October Southern California experienced significant wind events and dangerous fire weather conditions that escalated to historic levels Several winddriven wildfires broke out in Southern California with three firesSaddleridge Tick and Getty impacting District schools The Saddleridge fire broke out the evening of Thursday October in the San Fernando Valley which prompted the emergency closure of District schools within the mandatory evacuation and adjacent areas on Friday October The rest of the schools in Local Districts Northeast and Northwest as well as a few schools in Local District West were instructed to be on a minimum day schedule due to smoke and ash Due to the schools change in schedule four community day schools did not meet the States minimum instructional minutes and are therefore considered closed on this day In addition as a result of the change in schedule on October many schools will fall below the Districts minimum number of required annual instructional minutes although they will still meet state statutory requirements for annual instructional minutes Less than two days after the Saddleridge fire reached containment the Tick fire sparked in the afternoon of Thursday October in the Santa Clarita Valley Fueled by strong Santa Ana winds it quickly grew Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version causing massive mandatory evacuations and road closures in the area Due to smoke effects and safety concerns caused by fires in the region the District decided to close all schools in Local Districts Northeast and Northwest as well as a few schools in Local District West on Friday October This closure included satellite sites of multisite schools in other Local Districts As the Tick fire continued to burn the Getty fire ignited after am on Monday October in the Sepulveda Pass The fire quickly grew resulting in evacuations and road closures in the Brentwood area The fire continued to burn for several days with containment by Friday November Based on the Los Angeles Fire Departments evacuation zones or schools proximity to the fire the District closed schools for two to four days The Governor of California declared a State of Emergency for the Saddleridge and Tick fires on October and October respectively On October the Governor of California declared a State of Emergency for the entire state due to extreme fire weather conditions Gas Leak During the evening of Wednesday October SoCal Gas and District staff detected a gas leak near the front of the campus of Millikan Middle School Gas service was then shut off to accommodate repairs which were completed Thursday afternoon Out of an abundance of caution the District closed Millikan MS and its two magnet centers on Thursday October The complete list of school closures due to wildfires and the gas leak is in Attachment A Expected Outcomes The Boards adoption of the actions proposed Board Options and Consequences Adoption would enable staff to formally request from CDE allowance of attendance for K schools as well as to request enrollment reimbursement for early education centers and California State Preschool Program CSPP at elementary schools If not adopted the affected K schools will need to make up the lost instructional days in order to avoid a significant fiscal penalty for not meeting the statutory instructional days andor instructional minutes requirements Policy Implications Current policy as stated in Board Rule Closing of School by Superintendent states The Superintendent of Schools may direct the closing of any school whenever in his or her discretion such closing appears necessary to insure the health or safety of the students Any such action by the Superintendent shall be submitted to the Board of Education for confirmation at its next regular meeting The reopening of any school so closed shall be authorized when the Superintendent determines that the conditions which necessitated the closing have ceased to exist Amended Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version To address situations regarding the health and safety of students where the Superintendent of Schools determines a school must reduce instructional minutes for the day under this Board Rule the Board authorizes the Superintendent to waive policy for schools that do not meet District instructional minutes requirements as long as the school still meets state instructional minutes requirements Budget Impact The budget implications are contingent upon CDEs response to the Districts request for allowance of attendance for K schools and request for enrollment reimbursement for early education centers and CSPP at elementary schools If the Districts requests are approved K schools will be credited for the lost instructional days and instructional minutes and therefore would not need to make up the lost instructional days the District would be able to recoup a portion of the revenues lost at K schools due to increased absences the actual amount of which is yet to be determined and the District would be able to claim reimbursement of revenues for the lost days at early education centers and CSPP at elementary schools If not approved the District will incur the cost of providing additional days of instruction which would include the cost of various C basis staff and other expenditures Student Impact The student implications are contingent upon CDEs response to the Districts request for allowance of attendance for grades K schools If the Districts request is approved the affected schools will not need to make up the lost instructional days Therefore students at these schools would have been offered one to five days less instructional days for the school

Staff proposes that the Human Resources Divisions request for four teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit be approved pursuant to Title California Code of Regulations Section Background The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed During the first year of employment the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit Attachment A Additionally the CTC requires that the approval of these Permits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the consent agenda Expected Outcomes The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential Board Options and Consequences Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved and a fulltime teacher cannot be hired classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency Day Substitute Teaching Permits Daytoday substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Policy Implications This action does not change District policy Budget Impact There is no impact on the Districts budget Student Impact The goal of the Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom In areas of high need such as special education where there might be a teacher shortage the District may approve the use of Provisional Internship Permits which authorize a teacher candidate to step into the classroom as the teacher of record while they take

Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent FROM Jose R Cantu EdD Assistant Chief Human Resources Officer SUBJECT PROVISIONAL INTERNSHIP PERMITS INFORMATIVE DATE January Human Resources is seeking Board approval to hire four teachers on a Provisional Internship Permit This action will ensure that all special education classrooms are staffed with contracted teachers On December the Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC took action to discontinue the issuance of emergency permits Consequently all multiple subject single subject and educational specialist emergency permits expired as of June Notwithstanding that action the Commission was aware that there would be a continuing need for a document that addressed unmet credentialing or staffing needs of school districts in California With the assistance and input from a broadbased group of statewide stakeholders it was determined at the time that an authorization was still needed to staff classrooms when after a diligent search no appropriately credentialed teacher could be hired As a result the Commission developed the Provisional Internship Permit PIP The CTC Provisional Internship Permit is preferable to the formerly available emergency permit since the emphasis of this authorization is to prepare new teachers to enter accredited District or University Intern Programs The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three

identified position was taken to the governing board The notice must include the name of the applicant the school site and a statement that the individual will be employed under a Provisional Internship Permit The CTC also requires that the approval of these Provisional Internship Permits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the Consent agenda Additionally the District must provide evidence that an extensive recruitment outreach was conducted and that a shortage of fully qualified candidates exists Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January Staff proposes that the Board approve the employment of four new teachers under the Provisional Internship Permit Each provisional intern will receive support and guidance from Teacher Quality Staffing

Communities Res Noticed December and Discussed at December Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to providing a healthy environment for all students and staff to ensure that the physical behavioral social emotional and mental health needs of students are met Whereas The District through our mission statement will be a progressive global leader in education providing a dynamic and inspiring learning experience where all students graduate ready for success Whereas The District also enjoys a robust partnership with LA Trust for Childrens Health whose mission of student health is directly related to student academic success Whereas District educators and health professionals recognize the importance of tobacco use prevention education in order to reduce tobaccorelated illnesses and understand the best way to prevent tobaccorelated illnesses is to keep youth from starting to smoke or use tobacco products Whereas The District works with Los Angeles County Office of Education Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and other partnering public agencies to promote good health by discouraging tobacco use through the participation of District students in local Tobacco Use Prevention Education TUPE efforts Whereas Marketing by the tobacco industry has now targeted young people with packaging and names that appeal to youth as well as tobacco products that mask the harsh taste and odor of tobacco with flavors highly appealing to youth eg bubble gum cotton candy grape gummy bear chocolate chip cookie Whereas Tobacco companies and retailers profit from the researchproven fact that the earlier a person starts to use tobacco the harder it will become for them to quit Whereas Tobacco companies have historically targeted communities of color with aggressive marketing of mentholated tobacco products resulting in disproportionate rates of tobaccorelated disease and death eg of Black youth smokers of Asian youth smokers and of Latino youth smokers report use of mentholflavored cigarettes Whereas According to the US Surgeon General ecigarettes and other electronic nicotine devices ENDS contain nicotine which

providing student education and family information on the dangers of tobacco and vaping use Resolved further That the District call on our entire community of local civic and elected leaders to join in support of ensuring student health by refraining from the marketing and sales of tobacco flavored tobacco and vaping products to young people throughout the City of Los Angeles and the neighboring cities served by the District and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent directs staff to strongly support any and all civic social service and government agencies in their legislative efforts

Los Angeles Unified School District recently began collecting charter schools mandatory reimbursement obligation funds for the overallocation of Proposition space resulting from charter schools failures to generate the indistrict classroom average daily attendance that the charter schools projected for the applicable school year and Whereas District schools who host charter school colocations Home School are often limited in their use of school facilities such as auditoriums gyms libraries computer labs space for itinerant teachers and other room space now therefore be it Resolved That all overallocation reimbursement funds collected from a charter school shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was colocated Resolved further That any charter school overallocation reimbursement funds that have already been collected by the District shall be directed to the Home School at which the charter school is or was co located and be it

Waiver of Board Rule Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves an incredibly diverse population of over students and their families including languages spoken and over different nationalities Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has repeatedly affirmed its support for our immigrant students and families and the assets they bring to our schools including through Demanding Action on DREAMs Deferred Finding a Permanent Resolution for Undocumented Youth and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries Res Putting Kids First Means Keeping Families Together Res Declaring March as Immigrant Student Family and District Staff Month Res and Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement Res Whereas The We Are One LA Unified campaign was created to affirm that our schools are safe and welcoming places for immigrant families and to provide resources to help ensure their success including particular supports for undocumented students and students from mixedstatus families Whereas The District welcomed approximately newcomer students in the school year and will serve approximately newcomers in the school year ensuring they are provided the additional supports they need to be successful in school college career and life Whereas All children regardless of their immigration status are afforded certain unalienable rights under the US Constitution including the right to access a free public education Plyler v Doe Whereas Due to the actions of the federal government under the Trump Administration nearly migrant children were held in government custody in an increase of percent compared to the previous year Associated Press Whereas The median length of detention for children is days more than five months and some children have been in detention as long as a year and children have systematically been separated from their families causing potential longlasting detrimental effects according to the American Academy of Pediatrics March Whereas The United States is the only country in the United Nations body to have not ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child September and The United Nations Human Rights Office reported that the Trump administrations current zero tolerance practice of family separation amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life and is a serious violation of the rights of the child June Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Whereas

the development of a facility in Arleta in the East San Fernando Valley to house detained unaccompanied minors facing immigration proceedings and Whereas The detention of migrant children has no place in the communities of Los Angeles now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District categorically opposes VisionQuests proposal to open and operate a migrant youth detention center in Arleta as well as any other immigrant youth detention center within the Districts attendance boundaries as it is antithetical to the Districts core purpose of creating safe spaces for learning where student diversity is celebrated and an inherent part of achieving a st century education and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to

Res Version Mr Melvoin Ms Garca Ms Goldberg Increasing Equitable Access to Student Health Care Res Noticed November and Referred to Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District exists to provide every child in Los Angeles with a highquality education and believes that the educational success of a child should never be dictated or hindered by inequitable access to basic health services including vision and dental care Whereas The lived experience of our most vulnerable students demonstrates the reality of these critical inequities and the grave impact that an untreated toothache or inabilityp to see the board in class can have on a students ability to learn Whereas While various efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually there is still a large unmet need as percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since Whereas The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost Whereas In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administrations cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions this may include the District despite the Districts wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District Whereas California Senate Bill SB signed into law in helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites stating that if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment Whereas This law permits optout consent for oral health assessments which are typically more invasive than eye exams and the potential outfitting of glasses Whereas The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their childrens medical care while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary followup care with the proper health professionals we can do more to ensure Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses and Whereas School districts in California such as Compton Unified Inglewood Unified Pasadena Unified Lawndale Elementary Lennox School District Lynwood Unified Paramount Unified New Haven Unified San Leandro Unified Natomas Unified Alum Rock Unified Redwood City Monterey Peninsula Unified Mountain ViewWhisman School District and Newark Unified have all implemented successful optout consent programs for student eye exams now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and implement an optout consent program effective January wherein more students can have access to nocost vision and dental exams by health professionals Los

based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved further That the total cost of positions necessary to the basic operation of a school whether from Base or SC funds shall continue to be centrally funded and not deducted from schoolsite discretionary allocations currently distributed under codes and and be it finally Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Resolved That the Superintendent and District staff will report back within days on the threeyear enterprise plan to increase revenue to support the educational needs of students in all District schools as called for in Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education

scholars have come together to proclaim an annual week of action affirmation and solidarity called the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action Whereas The annual Black Lives Matter at School Week

Black community and to cultivate in Black students a sense of pride selfworth and selflove Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action is further intended to encourage ongoing critical reflection and courageous conversations concerning systemic racism social injustice racial and ethnic bias and to affirm the right of Black students to be treated with respect and dignity within schools and communities Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action may on the initiative of educators staff and students offer a variety of educational opportunities such as workshops

Representative Assembly and educators and school communities in Seattle Washington Washington DC Rochester City New York and Howard County Maryland among others have already endorsed or began

Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar TAB Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report Jump Back to Page File Res Version Ms Goldberg Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of Res Whereas For four decades school districts in California have experienced underinvestment and devastating cuts causing Californias school funding to fall behind and resulting in fewer services and resources for students and teachers Whereas The lack of adequate local funding is the result of an inequitable tax system in which corporations and wealthy investors do not pay their fair share in property taxes Whereas Loopholes in Californias property tax system allows a fraction of major commercial and industrial properties to avoid regular reassessment and use shady schemes to hide change in ownership Whereas These loopholes and tax schemes result in millions of dollars going to corporations and wealthy investors rather than to schools and local communities for essential services Whereas Experts estimate that the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act reclaims billion in property tax revenue every year to ensure that our schools and communities have the resources to educate all of our kids and the services to support all of our families Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act does not affect property taxes for homeowners or renters because the initiative exempts all residential property Whereas Academic researchers at the University of Southern California USC have identified that the vast majority of the reclaimed revenue will come from just a fraction of large properties Whereas California schools are falling behind ranking lowest in the nation with the largest number of students per teacher and the fewest counselors per student Whereas Perpupil funding has declined from the top in the nation to th Whereas The topranked state spends more perpupil to educate their children than California spends Whereas The measure invests up to billion annually for K schools to ensure that our kids receive the worldclass education they deserve Whereas California should be a leader in innovation by educating the next generation of students to compete in the global economy Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act guarantees funding to all school districts over and above Proposition funding and following the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF to all students in need in all districts Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Whereas The measure also provides billions in funding yearly for cities counties and special districts in locally controlled revenues for affordable housing parks libraries emergency responders health and human services libraries public infrastructure and much more Whereas The measure incentivizes the development of residential units and provides more funding for communities to invest in affordable housing Whereas The measure provides new tax incentives to spur new investment in small businesses by eliminating the business personal property tax on equipment for Californias small businesses Whereas The measure also exempts all small business owners whose property is worth million or less Whereas The measure levels the playing field for businesses that already pay their fair share in our communities and Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of is on the November ballot now therefore be it Resolved That the

Unified School Districts Commitment to Serving Students with ModeratetoSevere Disabilities Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over students receiving special education services Whereas The number and percentage of students with moderate to severe disabilities served by the District has steadily increased each year with the District serving over students with moderate to severe disabilities in the school year an percent increase from Whereas The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states local school districts and taxpayers to pay for needed services and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from Whereas In the school year the District spent over billion in special education costs with federal IDEA funding only reaching million accounting for just percent of the Districts expenditures woefully short of Congress commitment upon IDEAs passage to percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities Whereas According to the California Legislative Analysts Office local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities Whereas The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance AB providing Special Education Local Plan Areas SELPAs funding based on their overall student attendance regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide and Whereas The District proudly operates Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual students unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school now therefore be it Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with moderate to severe disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with moderate to severe disabilities Resolved further That the District formally recognizes December nd as Annual Special Education Day and encourages all schools and students to celebrate the diversity of their peers with disabilities Resolved further That the Board commits to continued advocacy for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the unique needs of the instructional programs and services for our students with moderatetosevere disabilities such as increasing Californias AB apportionments to meet the increases in special education costs Congress passing the IDEA Full Funding Act HR and Funding Early Childhood is the Right IDEA ActHR Resolved further That the Superintendent is directed to develop an advocacy strategy at both the state and federal level that is inclusive of families and educators of students with disabilities in order to improve the statewide special education system as well as push for sustained resources required to operate the Districts special education programs and be it

percent compared to the previous year Associated Press Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The median length of detention for children is days more than five months and some children have been in detention as long as a year and children have systematically been separated from their families causing potential longlasting detrimental effects according to the American Academy of Pediatrics March Whereas The United States is the only country in the United Nations body to have not ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child September and The United Nations Human Rights Office reported that the Trump administrations current zero tolerance practice of family separation amounts to arbitrary and unlawful interference in family life and is a serious violation of the rights of the child June Whereas VisionQuest a forprofit private corporation with a history of allegations of mistreatment of detained children dating back to the s Newsweek November has petitioned the City of Los Angeles to approve the development of a facility in Arleta in the East San Fernando Valley to house detained unaccompanied minors facing immigration proceedings and Whereas The detention of migrant children has no place in the communities of Los Angeles now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District categorically opposes VisionQuests proposal to open and operate a migrant youth detention center in Arleta as well as any other immigrant youth detention center within the Districts attendance boundaries as it is antithetical to the Districts core purpose of creating safe spaces for learning where student diversity is celebrated and an inherent part of achieving a st century education and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to formally share the Districts categorical opposition to VisionQuests proposal PARCM with the City of Los Angeles City Clerks Office and Los Angeles Planning and Zoning Department Board Member Resolutions Referred for Discussion Mr Melvoin Ms Garca Ms Goldberg Increasing Equitable Access to Student Health Care Res Noticed November and Referred to Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District exists to provide every child in Los Angeles with a highquality education and believes that the educational success of a child should never be dictated or hindered by inequitable access to basic health services including vision and dental care FOR ACTION MARCH Whereas The lived experience of our most vulnerable students demonstrates the reality of these critical inequities and the grave impact that an untreated toothache or inability to see the board in class can have on a students ability to learn Whereas While various efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually there is still a large unmet need as percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost Whereas In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administrations cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions this may include the District despite the Districts wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District Whereas California Senate Bill SB signed into law in helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites stating that if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment Whereas This law permits optout consent for oral health assessments which are typically more invasive than eye exams and the potential outfitting of glasses Whereas The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their childrens medical care while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary followup care with the proper health professionals we can do more to ensure that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses and Whereas School districts in California such as Compton Unified Inglewood Unified Pasadena Unified Lawndale Elementary Lennox School District Lynwood Unified Paramount Unified New Haven Unified San Leandro Unified Natomas Unified Alum Rock Unified Redwood City Monterey Peninsula Unified Mountain ViewWhisman School District and Newark Unified have all implemented successful optout consent programs for student eye exams now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop and implement an optout consent program effective January wherein more students can have access to nocost vision and dental exams by health professionals Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Board Member Resolutions for Initial Announcement Ms Goldberg SENI Refining the Student Equity Needs Index Based on Multiple Measures Providing Increased Funding for Concentrations of Qualifying Students with an Index and Funding Formula that Prioritize Equity Transparency and Stability Res REFERRED TO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Whereas The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF mechanism permits school districts to determine locally how to distribute the LCFF SupplementalConcentration SC grants to increase or improve services for the Targeted Student Population TSP enrollments Lower Income English Learner and Foster Youth students who qualify each district to receive these funds and whereas the Los Angeles Unified School District since the advent of LCFF has distributed a portion of the SC grants as Discretionary TSP funds to individual school sites based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved further That the total cost of positions necessary to the basic operation of a school whether from Base or SC funds shall continue to be centrally funded and not deducted from schoolsite discretionary allocations currently distributed under codes and and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of

Association endorsed the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action at its Representative Assembly and educators and school communities in Seattle Washington Washington DC Rochester City New York and Howard County Maryland among others have already endorsed or began implementing the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles

February or in any future week month or time and be it finally Resolved That the Board invites educators across grade levels and content areas to use resources that are inclusive of all our diverse learners to enrich instruction throughout the whole year Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna Mr Schmerelson Mr Melvoin Ms Gonez Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of Res Whereas For four decades school districts in California have experienced underinvestment and devastating cuts causing Californias school funding to fall behind and resulting in fewer services and resources for students and teachers FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas The lack of adequate local funding is the result of an inequitable tax system in which corporations and wealthy investors do not pay their fair share in property taxes Whereas Loopholes in Californias property tax system allows a fraction of major commercial and industrial properties to avoid regular reassessment and use shady schemes to hide change in ownership Whereas These loopholes and tax schemes result in millions of dollars going to corporations and wealthy investors rather than to schools and local communities for essential services Whereas Experts estimate that the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act reclaims billion in property tax revenue every year to ensure that our schools and communities have the resources to educate all of our kids and the services to support all of our families Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act does not affect property taxes for homeowners or renters because the initiative exempts all residential property Whereas Academic researchers at the University of Southern California USC have identified that the vast majority of the reclaimed revenue will come from just a fraction of large properties Whereas California schools are falling behind ranking lowest in the nation with the largest number of students per teacher and the fewest counselors per student Whereas Perpupil funding has declined from the top in the nation to th Whereas The topranked state spends more perpupil to educate their children than California spends Whereas The measure invests up to billion annually for K schools to ensure that our kids receive the worldclass education they deserve Whereas California should be a leader in innovation by educating the next generation of students to compete in the global economy Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act guarantees funding to all school districts over and above Proposition funding and following the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF to all students in need in all districts Whereas The measure also provides billions in funding yearly for cities counties and special districts in locally controlled revenues for affordable housing parks libraries emergency responders health and human services libraries public infrastructure and much more Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The measure incentivizes the development of residential units and provides more funding for communities to invest in affordable housing Whereas The measure provides new tax incentives to spur new investment in small businesses by eliminating the business personal property tax on equipment for Californias small businesses Whereas The measure also exempts all small business owners whose property is worth million or less Whereas The measure levels the playing field for businesses that already pay their fair share in our communities and Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of is on the November ballot now therefore be it Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District endorses the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of for a ballot measure in November Ms Gonez Ms Goldberg Recognizing and Reaffirming Los Angeles Unified School Districts Commitment to Serving Students with ModeratetoSevere Disabilities Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over students receiving special education services FOR ACTION FEBRAUARY Whereas The number and percentage of students with moderate to severe disabilities served by the District has steadily increased each year with the District serving over students with moderate to severe disabilities in the school year an percent increase from Whereas The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states local school districts and taxpayers to pay for needed services and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from Whereas In the school year the District spent over billion in special education costs with federal IDEA funding only reaching million accounting for just percent of the Districts expenditures woefully short of Congress commitment upon IDEAs passage to percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities Whereas According to the California Legislative Analysts Office local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance AB providing Special Education Local Plan Areas SELPAs funding based on their overall student attendance regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide and Whereas The District proudly operates Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual students unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school

Based on Multiple Measures Providing Increased Funding for Concentrations of Qualifying Students with an Index and Funding Formula that Prioritize Equity Transparency and Stability Res REFERRED TO COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Whereas The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF mechanism permits school districts to determine locally how to distribute the LCFF SupplementalConcentration SC grants to increase or improve services for the Targeted Student Population TSP enrollments Lower Income English Learner and Foster Youth students who qualify each district to receive these funds and whereas the Los Angeles Unified School District since the advent of LCFF has distributed a portion of the SC grants as Discretionary TSP funds to individual school sites based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved further That the total cost of positions necessary to the basic operation of a school whether from Base or SC funds shall continue to be centrally funded and not deducted from schoolsite discretionary allocations currently distributed under codes and and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolved That the Superintendent and District staff will report back within days on the three year enterprise plan to increase revenue to support the educational needs of students in all District schools as called for in Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna Ms Gonez Ms Suavillo Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action Res FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas A national movement of teachers parents administrators and scholars have come together to proclaim an annual week of action affirmation and solidarity called the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action Whereas The annual Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action will take place this year during the week of February to coincide with and augment Black History Month Whereas Schools should be places for encouraging equity fostering understanding and creating pathways to freedom and justice for all people Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action is intended to highlight uplift and affirm the rich history and contributions of the Black community and to cultivate in Black students a sense of pride selfworth and selflove Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action is further intended to encourage ongoing critical reflection and courageous conversations concerning systemic racism social injustice racial and ethnic bias and to affirm the right of Black students to be treated with respect and dignity within schools and communities Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action may on the initiative of educators staff and students offer a variety of educational opportunities such as workshops panel discussions cultural events instructional activities and expressions of unity and Whereas The National Education Association endorsed the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action at its Representative Assembly and educators and school communities in Seattle Washington Washington DC Rochester City New York and Howard County Maryland among others have already endorsed or began implementing the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District welcomes the participation of educators staff and students in communitybased activities and events related to the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action occurring during February or in any future week month or time and be it finally Resolved That the Board invites educators across grade levels and content areas to use resources that are inclusive of all our diverse learners to enrich instruction throughout the whole year Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna Mr Schmerelson Mr Melvoin Ms Gonez Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of Res Whereas For four decades school districts in California have experienced underinvestment and devastating cuts causing Californias school funding to fall behind and resulting in fewer services and resources for students and teachers FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas The lack of adequate local funding is the result of an inequitable tax system in which corporations and wealthy investors do not pay their fair share in property taxes Whereas Loopholes in Californias property tax system allows a fraction of major commercial and industrial properties to avoid regular reassessment and use shady schemes to hide change in ownership Whereas These loopholes and tax schemes result in millions of dollars going to corporations and wealthy investors rather than to schools and local communities for essential services Whereas Experts estimate that the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act reclaims billion in property tax revenue every year to ensure that our schools and communities have the resources to educate all of our kids and the services to support all of our families Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act does not affect property taxes for homeowners or renters because the initiative exempts all residential property Whereas Academic researchers at the University of Southern California USC have identified that the vast majority of the reclaimed revenue will come from just a fraction of large properties Whereas California schools are falling behind ranking lowest in the nation with the largest number of students per teacher and the fewest counselors per student Whereas Perpupil funding has declined from the top in the nation to th Whereas The topranked state spends more perpupil to educate their children than California spends Whereas The measure invests up to billion annually for K schools to ensure that our kids receive the worldclass education they deserve Whereas California should be a leader in innovation by educating the next generation of students to compete in the global economy Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act guarantees funding to all school districts over and above Proposition funding and following the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF to all students in need in all districts Whereas The measure also provides billions in funding yearly for cities counties and special districts in locally controlled revenues for affordable housing parks libraries emergency responders health and human services libraries public infrastructure and much more Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The measure incentivizes the development of residential units and provides more funding for communities to invest in affordable housing Whereas The measure provides new tax incentives to spur new investment in small businesses by eliminating the business personal property tax on equipment for Californias small businesses Whereas The measure also exempts all small business owners whose property is worth million or less Whereas The measure levels the playing field for businesses that already pay their fair share in our communities and Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of is on the November ballot now therefore be it Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District endorses the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of for a ballot measure in November Ms Gonez Ms Goldberg Recognizing and Reaffirming Los Angeles Unified School Districts Commitment to Serving Students with ModeratetoSevere Disabilities Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over students receiving special education services FOR ACTION FEBRAUARY Whereas The number and percentage of students with moderate to severe disabilities served by the District has steadily increased each year with the District serving over students with moderate to severe disabilities in the school year an percent increase from Whereas The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states local school districts and taxpayers to pay for needed services and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from Whereas In the school year the District spent over billion in special education costs with federal IDEA funding only reaching million accounting for just percent of the Districts expenditures woefully short of Congress commitment upon IDEAs passage to percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities Whereas According to the California Legislative Analysts Office local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance AB providing Special Education Local Plan Areas SELPAs funding based on their overall student attendance regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide and Whereas The District proudly operates Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual students unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with moderate to severe disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with moderate to severe disabilities Resolved further That the District formally recognizes December nd as Annual Special Education Day and encourages all schools and students to celebrate the diversity of their peers with disabilities Resolved further That the Board commits to continued advocacy for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the unique needs of the instructional programs and services for our students with moderatetosevere disabilities such as increasing Californias AB apportionments to meet the increases in special education costs Congress passing the IDEA Full Funding Act HR and Funding Early Childhood is the Right IDEA Act HR Resolved further That the Superintendent is directed to develop an advocacy strategy at both the state and federal level that is inclusive of families and educators of students with disabilities in order to improve the statewide special education system as well as push for sustained resources required to operate the Districts special education programs and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to develop more regular opportunities for parents and families of Students with moderatetosevere disabilities to engage with the District to provide meaningful feedback

and support for students and their parents can greatly ease the internal and external barriers to college attendance and enhance confidence in a students capacity to prepare for and acquire a college education With the inherent complexity and confusion of the college and financial aid application processes programs that build college knowledge fostering supportive personnel who build relationships and help students and their families prepare for change can be an essential element of making a successful transition from high school to postsecondary opportunities Why do we need to do this now With the unexpected collapse of Youth Policy Institute Bright Star Schools is attempting to make LA Unifieds GEAR UP LA the fiscal agent of their GEAR UP grant pending US Department of Educations approval This is a million dollar grant that serves school sites over a six year period The District has already exhausted the authorized expenditure of the current bench for college access and parent support services contracts In order to meet the needs of students the Division of Instruction is requesting an increase of five million dollars The approval of the increase the amount on the bench contract will enable schools and offices to continue to engage college readiness and parent support services The Districts priority is to increase graduation rates college and career readiness as well as increased opportunities to attend and complete college degrees What would happen if this were not approved Without an approved increase the District will be unable to provide our students continued access to the quality of the services that the Request for Proposals contracts provide Without the scale of Districtwide bench contract pricing any contracted services are likely to be more expensive and schools and offices would need to compete bids every time they wanted to access services What are the terms of the proposed agreement All renewal options for this bench of contracts have now been exercised All services materials and prices will be detailed in a summary catalogue so that the range of choices is readily available apparent to principals and administrators Once a service provider is selected a school or office will issue a shopping cart requisitions that will generate a purchase order to the vendor Ongoing evaluations of the providers will result in shared information that will enable access to the highest rate of service Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January If you have any questions or require additional information please contact me at

ensure consistent pricing resulting in lower overall cost for the District What would happen if this were not approved LAUSD will likely pay higher prices for the vehicle and equipment parts and those parts may not be covered by warranty language that is included in the cooperative contracts In some cases without a contract TSD will not be able to procure the required parts and services What are

into Memorandum of Understanding with Los Angeles Beautification Team January Facilities Services Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Board of Education Board approves entering into a Memorandum of Understanding MOU between the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD and Hollywood Beautification Team dba Los Angeles Beautification Team LABT Staff further proposes that the Board authorize the Chief Facilities Executive andor their designees to execute all instruments necessary as legally permissible to implement the MOU Background LAUSD seeks to help ensure its school sites benefit from the positive environmental impact of planting trees within their campuses Recognizing that trees help reduce greenhouse gases provide shade reduce the heat island effect and improve the school environment LAUSD seeks to enter into partnerships that will allow nonprofit organizations the ability to install new or replacement trees This MOU will allow LABT to provide programmatic and monetary resources if and when available to support the planting and caring for trees at LAUSD campuses The tree planting program consists of three primary programmatic strategies LABT acquiring trees through grant opportunities donations etc LABT providing materials and volunteers to plant trees on campuses throughout the District and LABT providing followup and support for the first year While all LAUSD school sites are eligible to receive new or replacement trees the geographic areas of the recipient school sites will be based on the conditions imposed by external funding sources such as grant programs that provide funding for projects located within defined geographic boundaries LABT will coordinate with LAUSD Facilities staff to identify potential school sites for planting of Districtapproved tree species on these campuses LABT and LAUSD will seek to achieve equitable distribution of new trees throughout the District as funds for these efforts are identified Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board will approve entering into this MOU to permit the District and LABT to begin planning activities and identifying school sites for the installation of District approved trees as funding becomes available via grants and other external funding sources Board Options and Consequences Approval of this action will allow staff to begin working with LABT to select school sites and tree installation locations on campuses Approval will also allow LABT to install trees at schools at LAUSD approved locations that will help green those campuses combat greenhouse gases improve air quality and improve the overall campus environments If the proposed action is not approved this tree planting program will not move forward Los Angeles Unified School District Page

District funding Under this MOU installation of trees will be funded by grants or other external funding sources LABT will subject to funding availability pay for all programmatic activities performed including care and support of newly installed trees for the first year and the District will maintain the trees in accordance with and to the degree permitted by its annual Maintenance Operations MO budget Staff time and activities associated with administering the MOU will be funded by MO General Funds using existing staff Student Impact Students attending selected schools that meet the conditions of LABT acquired grants or other external funds will benefit from these new trees that will help create new canopy cover increase campus greening and mitigate local pollution The proposed installation of new trees will contribute to a reduction in harmful greenhouse gas emissions reduce urban heat island effect and improve local air quality for students Issues and Analysis The District understands the importance of providing green spaces on our campuses for student and teacher health and as a means to encourage ecological health for the region The installation of new trees under the proposed MOU helps establish and maintain healthy and vibrant school campuses As limited funding continues to be a challenge the MOU allows the District to increase green spaces through a partnership at no additional cost to the District In keeping with the terms of the MOU LABT must coordinate with LAUSD Facilities staff before the selection of any recipient school sites and gain District approval before scheduling tree planting activities LABT must follow District protocol guidelines specifications and provide all required District permits signed waivers and insurance as applicable

Background On February the Board approved the Gratts Primary Center and Early Education Center project Project Board Report No In June Staff applied to the City to vacate a portion of the alley adjacent to the school site for the construction of the Project As a condition of the proposed alley vacation application Los Angeles Unified was required to construct and dedicate to the City a new access to the existing alley from Lucas Avenue In March the Board authorized the dedication of an easement over the new alley access to the City The alley access easement was recorded on April The initial Los Angeles Unified alley vacation application expired prior to completion but was readopted by the Los Angeles City Council on March During the reevaluation of the current Los Angeles Unified alley vacation application the City determined that it failed to previously require a foot wide strip on the northern end of the public alley be dedicated to align with the width of the alley as eventually constructed To correct this oversight the City requires Los Angeles Unified to dedicate a foot wide easement over the completed alley as shown on Exhibit B The dedication of the proposed easement is necessary to satisfy the remaining conditions of the alley vacation application and ensure the Citys responsibility to maintain and repair the entire public alley Los Angeles Unified

Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report Jump Back to Page File Rep Version ADOPTED BY CONSENT VOTE Material Decrease in Attendance and Emergency Closure of District Schools and Centers due to Wildfires and a Gas Leak in October Request for Allowance of Attendance Due to an Emergency Condition Payment of Employees January Office of the Chief Financial Officer Action Proposed The Board of Education finds that the emergency closure of the District schools listed in Attachment A which includes K schools affiliated charter schools Division of Adult and Career Education DACE schools and Early Childhood Education Programs was necessary due to emergency conditions The Board of Education authorizes staff to take all necessary actions to obtain allowance of attendance from the California Department of Education CDE for the emergency closures as well as for the material decrease in attendance that schools may have experienced due to the emergency conditions as permitted by Education Code section The waiver application for emergency closure and material decrease in attendance may be sent to CDE at different times due to data gathering requirements The Board of Education ratifies payment of salaries for staff who were unable to report for duty due to emergency school closures road closures or evacuations as applicable for October and The Board of Education confirms the closure of the schools listed in Attachment A Background In October Southern California experienced significant wind events and dangerous fire weather conditions that escalated to historic levels Several winddriven wildfires broke out in Southern California with three firesSaddleridge Tick and Getty impacting District schools The Saddleridge fire broke out the evening of Thursday October in the San Fernando Valley which prompted the emergency closure of District schools within the mandatory evacuation and adjacent areas on Friday October The rest of the schools in Local Districts Northeast and Northwest as well as a few schools in Local District West were instructed to be on a minimum day schedule due to smoke and ash Due to the schools change in schedule four community day schools did not meet the States minimum instructional minutes and are therefore considered closed on this day In addition as a result of the change in schedule on October many schools will fall below the Districts minimum number of required annual instructional minutes although they will still meet state statutory requirements for annual instructional minutes Less than two days after the Saddleridge fire reached containment the Tick fire sparked in the afternoon of Thursday October in the Santa Clarita Valley Fueled by strong Santa Ana winds it quickly grew Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version causing massive mandatory evacuations and road closures in the area Due to smoke effects and safety concerns caused by fires in the region the District decided to close all schools in Local Districts Northeast and Northwest as well as a few schools in Local District West on Friday October This closure included satellite sites of multisite schools in other Local Districts As the Tick fire continued to burn the Getty fire ignited after am on Monday October in the Sepulveda Pass The fire quickly grew resulting in evacuations and road closures in the Brentwood area The fire continued to burn for several days with containment by Friday November Based on the Los Angeles Fire Departments evacuation zones or schools proximity to the fire the District closed schools for two to four days The Governor of California declared a State of Emergency for the Saddleridge and Tick fires on October and October respectively On October the Governor of California declared a State of Emergency for the entire state due to extreme fire weather conditions Gas Leak During the evening of Wednesday October SoCal Gas and District staff detected a gas leak near the front of the campus of Millikan Middle School Gas service was then shut off to accommodate repairs which were completed Thursday afternoon Out of an abundance of caution the District closed Millikan MS and its two magnet centers on Thursday October The complete list of school closures due to wildfires and the gas leak is in Attachment A Expected Outcomes The Boards adoption of the actions proposed Board Options and Consequences Adoption would enable staff to formally request from CDE allowance of attendance for K schools as well as to request enrollment reimbursement for early education centers and California State Preschool Program CSPP at elementary schools If not adopted the affected K schools will need to make up the lost instructional days in order to avoid a significant fiscal penalty for not meeting the statutory instructional days andor instructional minutes requirements Policy Implications Current policy as stated in Board Rule Closing of School by Superintendent states The Superintendent of Schools may direct the closing of any school whenever in his or her discretion such closing appears necessary to insure the health or safety of the students Any such action by the Superintendent shall be submitted to the Board of Education for confirmation at its next regular meeting The reopening of any school so closed shall be authorized when the Superintendent determines that the conditions which necessitated the closing have ceased to exist Amended Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version To address situations regarding the health and safety of students where the Superintendent of Schools determines a school must reduce instructional minutes for the day under this Board Rule the Board authorizes the Superintendent to waive policy for schools that do not meet District instructional minutes requirements as long as the school still meets state instructional minutes requirements Budget Impact The budget implications are contingent upon CDEs response to the Districts request for allowance of attendance for K schools and request for enrollment reimbursement for early education centers and CSPP at elementary schools If the Districts requests are approved K schools will be credited for the lost instructional days and instructional minutes and therefore would not need to make up the lost instructional days the District would be able to recoup a portion of the revenues lost at K schools due to increased absences the actual amount of which is yet to be determined and the District would be able to claim reimbursement of revenues for the lost days at early education centers and CSPP at elementary schools If not approved the District will incur the cost of providing additional days of instruction which would include the cost of various C basis staff and other expenditures Student Impact The student implications are contingent upon CDEs response to the Districts request for allowance of attendance for grades K schools If the Districts request is approved the affected schools will not need to make up the lost instructional days Therefore students at these schools would have been offered one to five days less instructional days for the school year Issues and Analysis NA Attachments Attachment A

January Human Resources Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Human Resources Divisions request for four teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit be approved pursuant to Title California Code of Regulations Section Background The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed During the first year of employment the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit Attachment A Additionally the CTC requires that the approval of these Permits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the consent agenda Expected Outcomes The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential Board Options and Consequences Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved and a fulltime teacher cannot be hired classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency Day Substitute Teaching Permits Daytoday

INTERNSHIP PERMITS INFORMATIVE DATE January Human Resources is seeking Board approval to hire four teachers on a Provisional Internship Permit This action will ensure that all special education classrooms are staffed with contracted teachers On December the Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC took action to discontinue the issuance of emergency permits Consequently all multiple subject single subject and educational specialist emergency permits expired as of June Notwithstanding that action the Commission was aware that there would be a continuing need for a document that addressed unmet credentialing or staffing needs of school districts in California With the assistance and input from a broadbased group of statewide stakeholders it was determined at the time that an authorization was still needed to staff classrooms when after a diligent search no appropriately credentialed teacher could be hired As a result the Commission developed the Provisional Internship Permit PIP The CTC Provisional Internship Permit is preferable to the formerly available emergency permit since the emphasis of this authorization is to prepare new teachers to enter accredited District or University Intern Programs The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teacher beginning their assignment Requests to the Commission for a Provisional Internship Permit must include verification that a notice of intent to employ the applicant in the identified position was taken to the governing board The notice must include the name of the applicant the school site and a statement that the individual will be employed under a Provisional Internship Permit The CTC also requires that the approval of these Provisional Internship Permits be an action item on the agenda and

Garca Ms Goldberg Increasing Equitable Access to Student Health Care Res Noticed November and Referred to Committee of the Whole Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District exists to provide every child in Los Angeles with a highquality education and believes that the educational success of a child should never be dictated or hindered by inequitable access to basic health services including vision and dental care Whereas The lived experience of our most vulnerable students demonstrates the reality of these critical inequities and the grave impact that an untreated toothache or inabilityp to see the board in class can have on a students ability to learn Whereas While various efforts and partnerships have helped us counter some of this inequity by providing vision and dental screenings to thousands of District students annually there is still a large unmet need as percent of our student population is living in poverty and the number of children in the United States living without health insurance has been on the rise since Whereas The District emphatically strives to ensure the ability of all students to focus on learning and grow up healthy and supports opportunities to increase equitable access and make it easier for underserved students to benefit from this important care at no cost Whereas In the current climate instigated by the current Federal administrations cruel and inhumane immigration policies and practices some of our most vulnerable families are more reluctant to provide personal information to any institutions for fear of repercussions this may include the District despite the Districts wholehearted efforts to ensure that families and students feel supported and protected in our schools and in communicating with the District Whereas California Senate Bill SB signed into law in helped to streamline family consent for children to receive oral health assessments at school sites stating that if a school or school district hosts a free oral health assessment event at which licensed dentists or other licensed or registered dental health professionals perform school site assessments of pupils enrolled in the school a pupil shall be given an oral health assessment unless the parent or legal guardian of the pupil has opted out of the school site assessment Whereas This law permits optout consent for oral health assessments which are typically more invasive than eye exams and the potential outfitting of glasses Whereas The District affirms the constitutional rights of parents to make decisions about their childrens medical care while also recognizing that California public schools are legally required to provide vision screenings in elementary school or upon first enrollment and if we are then able to facilitate the necessary followup care with the proper health professionals we can do more to ensure Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version that no child who needs glasses has to live without glasses and Whereas School districts in California such as Compton Unified Inglewood Unified Pasadena Unified Lawndale Elementary Lennox School District Lynwood Unified Paramount Unified New Haven Unified San Leandro Unified Natomas Unified Alum Rock Unified Redwood City Monterey Peninsula Unified Mountain ViewWhisman School District and Newark Unified have all implemented successful optout consent programs for student eye exams now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Ms Goldberg SENI Refining the Student Equity Needs Index Based on Multiple Measures Providing Increased Funding for Concentrations of Qualifying Students with an Index and Funding Formula that Prioritize Equity Transparency and Stability Res Whereas The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF mechanism permits school districts to determine locally how to distribute the LCFF SupplementalConcentration SC grants to increase or improve services for the Targeted Student Population TSP enrollments Lower Income English Learner and Foster Youth students who qualify each district to receive these funds and whereas the Los Angeles Unified School District since the advent of LCFF has distributed a portion of the SC grants as Discretionary TSP funds to individual school sites based on the enrollment of TSP students at each school Whereas Advocacy to concentrate SC grant moneys at higher needs schools led to the approval of the resolution Equity is Justice Moving Toward a New Direction Res now known as SENI on April which ranked schools according to an index that included additional factors internal and external to schools and resulted in the distribution of TSP discretionary school site funds under District codes and via an iteration of the Index known as SENI Whereas The SENI factors have decoupled funding rates from actual enrollment of qualifying students on campuses and will cause volatile swings in funding rates yeartoyear at individual school sites once hold harmless funding ends Whereas SENI relied on hold harmless funds under code to prevent immediate cuts to TSP funding at schools with significant TSP enrollments including even schools with over percent enrollments of Lower Income students and TSP students risk harm to their educational programs without a plan to focus funding at the schools they attend Whereas The application of SENI caused schools with significant concentrations of qualifying students to receive reduced amounts of TSP discretionary school site funds under code forcing those schools to face reduced services and resources for their students Whereas The Great Recession of led to a significant reduction in state funding for public education Whereas The District in response to this funding reduction instituted in a set of budget cuts known as the Base Program Whereas The Base Program was determined by Education Code floors Court OrdersDecreesSettlements Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Minimal operational recommendations and Bargaining Agreements Whereas Implementation of this Base Program led to significant reductions in onschool site personnel such that schools were reduced to having a nurse on site only one day per week only one building and grounds worker the front office clerical staff at each school was reduced to two positions high school counselors became responsible for a minimum of students etc Whereas Sending discretionary TSP funding to the schools based on the enrollment of qualifying TSP students permits sustainable and efficacious programming and staffing to support these students learning based on transparent measures Whereas Increasing the number of duplicated categories of students counted in SENI where those categories are related to the essential mandate of LCFF acknowledges the challenges for schools with high concentrations of students who are facing multiple stressors in their lives and Whereas A fundamental issue with school budgets that prevents equitable funding from having more appreciable effects on closing the opportunity gap is the inadequacy of school funding in California which ranks st in the nation in per pupil spending despite being the th largest economy in the world and this inadequacy derives from the wealth gap that creates the conditions in which our schools struggle to remove hurdles to our students reaching their full academic potential now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and District staff to construct SENI consisting of a ranking of schools levels of need calculated from the duplicated percentage of a schools population of students who are Lower Income English Learners including Standard English Learners Foster Youth and TSP Special Education Students defined for the purposes of the SENI as students with IEPs and who are also English Learners Foster Youth or Lower Income students and Rolling year averages of Homeless Students NewcomerImmigrant Youth as defined in Federal Title III regulations and Reentry Youth students enrolling or reenrolling in District schools after juvenile court detention or camp placement Resolved further That sufficient funds shall be allocated to the SENI program such that the per capita allocation to every campus beginning with and subsequent to the school year shall be higher than the per capita allocation to the same campus during and the total amount will be deposited in the schools TSPStudent Equity Needs Index program program code Resolved further That the total cost of positions necessary to the basic operation of a school whether from Base or SC funds shall continue to be centrally funded and not deducted from schoolsite discretionary allocations currently distributed under codes and and be it finally Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Resolved That the Superintendent and District staff will report back within days on the threeyear enterprise plan to increase revenue to support the educational needs of students in all District schools as called for in Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar TAB Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report Jump Back to Page File Res Version FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna Ms Gonez Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action Res Whereas A national movement of teachers parents administrators and scholars have come together to proclaim an annual week of action affirmation and solidarity called the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action Whereas The annual Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action will take place this year during the week of February to coincide with and augment Black History Month Whereas Schools should be places for encouraging equity fostering understanding and creating pathways to freedom and justice for all people Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action is intended to highlight uplift and affirm the rich history and contributions of the Black community and to cultivate in Black students a sense of pride selfworth and selflove Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action is further intended to encourage ongoing critical reflection and courageous conversations concerning systemic racism social injustice racial and ethnic bias and to affirm the right of Black students to be treated with respect and dignity within schools and communities Whereas The Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action may on the initiative of educators staff and students offer a variety of educational opportunities such as workshops panel discussions cultural events instructional activities and expressions of unity and Whereas The National Education Association endorsed the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action at its Representative Assembly and educators and school communities in Seattle Washington Washington DC Rochester City New York and Howard County Maryland among others have already endorsed or began implementing the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District welcomes the participation of educators staff and students in communitybased activities and events related to the Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action occurring during February or in any future week month or time and be it finally Resolved That the Board invites educators across grade levels and content areas to use resources that are inclusive of all our diverse learners to enrich instruction throughout the whole year Los

Version FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Ms Goldberg Dr McKenna Mr Schmerelson Mr Melvoin Ms Gonez Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of Res Whereas For four decades school districts in California have experienced underinvestment and devastating cuts causing Californias school funding to fall behind and resulting in fewer services and resources for students and teachers Whereas The lack of adequate local funding is the result of an inequitable tax system in which corporations and wealthy investors do not pay their fair share in property taxes Whereas Loopholes in Californias property tax system allows a fraction of major commercial and industrial properties to avoid regular reassessment and use shady schemes to hide change in ownership Whereas These loopholes and tax schemes result in millions of dollars going to corporations and wealthy investors rather than to schools and local communities for essential services Whereas Experts estimate that the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act reclaims billion in property tax revenue every year to ensure that our schools and communities have the resources to educate all of our kids and the services to support all of our families Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act does not affect property taxes for homeowners or renters because the initiative exempts all residential property Whereas Academic researchers at the University of Southern California USC have identified that the vast majority of the reclaimed revenue will come from just a fraction of large properties Whereas California schools are falling behind ranking lowest in the nation with the largest number of students per teacher and the fewest counselors per student Whereas Perpupil funding has declined from the top in the nation to th Whereas The topranked state spends more perpupil to educate their children than California spends Whereas The measure invests up to billion annually for K schools to ensure that our kids receive the worldclass education they deserve Whereas California should be a leader in innovation by educating the next generation of students to compete in the global economy Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act guarantees funding to all school districts over and above Proposition funding and following the Local Control Funding Formula Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version LCFF to all students in need in all districts Whereas The measure also provides billions in funding yearly for cities counties and special districts in locally controlled revenues for affordable housing parks libraries emergency responders health and human services libraries public infrastructure and much more Whereas The measure incentivizes the development of residential units and provides more funding for communities to invest in affordable housing Whereas The measure provides new tax incentives to spur new investment in small businesses by eliminating the business personal property tax on equipment for Californias small businesses Whereas The measure also exempts all small business owners whose property is worth million or less Whereas The measure levels the playing field for businesses that already pay their fair share in our communities and Whereas The California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of is on the November ballot now therefore be it Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District endorses the California Schools and Local Communities Funding Act of for a ballot measure in November Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar TAB Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report Jump Back to Page File Res Version FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Ms Gonez Ms Goldberg Recognizing and Reaffirming Los Angeles Unified School Districts Commitment to Serving Students with ModeratetoSevere Disabilities Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District proudly serves over students receiving special education services Whereas The number and percentage of students with moderate to severe disabilities served by the District has steadily increased each year with the District serving over students with moderate to severe disabilities in the school year an percent increase from Whereas The chronic underfunding of the federal law now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA by the federal government places an additional funding burden on states local school districts and taxpayers to pay for needed services and often means using local budget dollars to cover the federal shortfall ultimately shortchanging other school programs that students with disabilities often also benefit from Whereas In the school year the District spent over billion in special education costs with federal IDEA funding only reaching million accounting for just percent of the Districts expenditures woefully short of Congress commitment upon IDEAs passage to percent of the additional costs necessary to provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities Whereas According to the California Legislative Analysts Office local funding has been covering an increasing share of special education expenditures percent in as compared to percent in with an estimated twothirds of the cost increases due to a rise in the incidence of students with moderate to severe disabilities November Whereas The inadequate level of funding for Special Education at both the federal and state level does not differentiate funding based on the severity of the students disability and therefore fails to recognize the additional resources required to adequately meet the needs of students with moderate to severe disabilities Whereas The majority of the current state funding structure for Special Education is based on student attendance AB providing Special Education Local Plan Areas SELPAs funding based on their overall student attendance regardless of how many students with disabilities the SELPA serves or the services they provide and Whereas The District proudly operates Special Education and Career Transition Centers which provide students with a robust instructional program that meets each individual students unique needs and prepares them and their families for their transition beyond secondary school now therefore be it Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Res Version Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes and celebrates the unique assets and needs of our students with moderate to severe disabilities and is proud to serve them and their families in light of the shameful historic exclusion of students with moderate to severe disabilities Resolved further That the District formally recognizes December nd as Annual Special Education Day and encourages all schools and students to celebrate the diversity of their peers with disabilities Resolved further That the Board commits to continued advocacy for additional resources that will adequately resource and sustain the unique needs of the instructional programs and services for our students with moderatetosevere disabilities such as increasing Californias AB apportionments to meet the increases in special education costs Congress passing the IDEA Full Funding Act HR and Funding Early Childhood is the Right IDEA ActHR Resolved further That the Superintendent is directed to develop an advocacy strategy at both the state and federal level that is inclusive of families and educators of students with disabilities in order to improve the statewide special education system as well as push for sustained resources required to operate the Districts special education programs and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent is directed to develop more regular opportunities for parents and families of Students with moderatetosevere disabilities to engage with the District to provide meaningful feedback opportunities for continuous improvement and strengthen partnerships and resources

Discussion and Analysis MDA The MDA provides an objective and easily readable analysis of the Districts financial activities on both a shortterm and longterm basis This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MDA and should be read in conjunction with it The Districts MDA can be found immediately following the report of the independent auditors Profile of the Los Angeles Unified School District The District encompasses approximately square miles in the western section of Los Angeles County The Districts boundaries include most of the City of Los Angeles all of the Cities of Cudahy Gardena Huntington Park Lomita Maywood San Fernando Vernon and West Hollywood and portions of the Cities of Bell Bell Gardens Beverly Hills Calabasas Carson Commerce Culver City Hawthorne Inglewood Long Beach Lynwood Montebello Monterey Park Rancho Palos Verdes Santa Clarita South Gate and Torrance The District was formed in as the Common Schools for the City of Los Angeles and became a unified school district in i As of June the District operated elementary schools middlejunior high schools senior high schools options schools multilevel schools special education schools magnet schools and magnet centers community adult schools regional occupational centers skills center early education centers infant centers and primary school centers The District is governed by a sevenmember Board of Education elected by voters within the District to serve alternating fiveyear terms These terms were extended to five years for members elected in and thereafter As of June the District employed certificated classified and unclassified employees Enrollment as of September was students in K schools students in adult schools and centers and children in early education centers As a reporting entity the District is accountable for all activities related to public education in most of the western section of Los Angeles County This report includes all funds of the District with the exception of the fiscally independent charter schools which are required to submit their own individual audited financial statements and the Auxiliary Services Trust Fund which is not significant in relation to District operations The Auxiliary Services Trust Fund was established in to receive and disburse funds for insurance premiums on student body activities and property all city athletic and musical events grants restricted for student activities and other miscellaneous activities Economic Condition and Outlook The UCLA Anderson Forecast in its third quarterly report of is not calling for a recession but rather a slow growth over its threeyear forecast period The national forecast in real gross domestic product GDP growth is in in and rebounds back to in The report also cited six economic concerns namely trade war with China the weakening of business investment in equipment and structures the negatively sloped yield curve the slowdown in employment growth the inability of housing activity to launch and the stagnant stock market For California the UCLA Anderson Forecast notes that the Golden State continues to outpace the nation in terms of job creation and economic growth because of its productivity gains through employment of labor augmenting technology However the state economy is anticipated to weaken in the late due to the slowing US and global economy Real personal income growth is predicted to be and in and respectively The California forecast for employment growth is in in and in On the other hand unemployment rate for California is expected to average at for the entire years of and As of October preliminary data from Bureau of Labor Statistics shows unemployment rate is for the nation and for California The Legislative Analyst Offices LAO Fiscal Outlook for the Budget estimates the Proposition minimum guarantee at billion an increase of billion over the revised level Proposition is the measure passed by California voters in that establishes a minimum funding requirement for the K education commonly referred to as the minimum guarantee It is also estimated that the State will have billion available for new commitments or programs in after using billion to fund a statutory costofliving adjustment COLA and changes in student attendance and the required deposit of million into the Proposition Reserve One part of the fiscal outlook report further explains how the minimum guarantee could change through under two possible economic scenarios Under the growth scenario the minimum guarantee increases gradually to billion in from billion in an average annual increase of billion or percent over this period Under the recession scenario the minimum guarantee is slowing down and estimated at billion in The guarantee is projected to drop below the level in the growth scenario by billion in billion in and billion in Furthermore the report points out that the State not only would be unable to fund COLA in and but would also need to reduce spending assuming it funds at the lower minimum guarantee ii Superintendents Strategic Plan The Strategic Plan represents LA Unifieds commitment to graduation This will be achieved through excellence high expectations and continuous learning The plan also outlines fundamental strategy the essential elements of effective learning environments objectives and key initiatives The plan is intended to cultivate common understanding and coherence and to empower all stakeholders to take action toward creating a district of graduates It provides the prioritized framework from which LA Unified will work In its relentless pursuit to educate graduate and inspire its diverse student population LA Unified must make certain that it has access to the highest caliber staff and services available It must also guarantee that families are actively and meaningfully involved Each and every person plays an important role in meeting the academic socialemotional and physical needs of LA Unified students Financial Information The District maintains internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use and disposition and to provide reliable records for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes the importance of a close evaluation of costs and benefits which requires estimates and judgments by management The objective is to establish effective internal controls the cost of which should not exceed the benefits derived therefrom We believe that the Districts internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of proper recording of financial transactions School districts in California are required by Education Code Section to follow the California School Accounting Manual in preparing reports to the State The District utilizes a singleadoption budget schedule that requires Final Budget adoption by the Statemandated July deadline The District is allowed to modify its adopted budget within days of the passage of the State budget Education Code Section EC mandates that a school districts expenditures may not legally exceed budgeted appropriations by major object classification namely certificated salaries classified salaries employee benefits books and supplies services and other operating expenditures capital outlay other outgo and other financing uses EC further specifies that districts may not spend more than the amounts authorized in the Final Budget as adjusted during the fiscal year to ensure effective budgetary control and accountability Encumbrance accounting Unencumbered appropriations lapse at year end and encumbrances outstanding at that time are reported as assigned fund balance for subsequent year expenditures is utilized Financial Results In the Statement of Changes in Net Position shows that the Districts Net Position increased by billion during the year The Unrestricted Net Position which is negative improved from billion to billion The negative Unrestricted Net Position is largely the result of net other postemployment OPEB liability and net pension liability for various retirement plans The noted increase in the Districts Net Position is primarily attributable to a change in the Districts implementation of a more costeffective health care plan resulting in a significant reduction in its Net OPEB liability In contrast the net pension liability continues to increase as the Districts proportionate share of the unfunded liability rises In the fund balance of the General Fund increased by billion from billion to billion This slight increase was due to overall savings from the operating expenditures iii BOARD OF EDUCATION Dr Richard A Vladovic President Board District Dr George J McKenna III Board District Mnica Garca Board District Scott Schmerelson Board District Nick

Districts internal control over financial reporting and compliance Los Angeles California December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June As management of the Los Angeles Unified School District we offer readers of the Districts financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal which can be found on pages iiv of this report Financial Highlights cid The liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources of the District exceeded its assets plus deferred outflows of resources at the close of the most recent fiscal year by billion net position This amount includes billion deficit in unrestricted net position resulting primarily from the net pension liability for various retirement plans totaling billion and the net other postemployment benefits OPEB liability totaling billion cid The Districts total net position increased by billion from the prior year primarily due to decrease in the net OPEB liability by billion The decrease was primarily due to the Districts implementation of a more costeffective health care plan cid The Districts total longterm liabilities decreased by billion during the current fiscal year The decrease resulted primarily from debt service payments of the General Obligation bonds and Certificates of Participation COPs cid As of the close of the fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of billion from the fiscal year ended June cid At the end of the current fiscal year assigned and unassigned fund balances for the General Fund including reserve for economic uncertainties was billion or of total General Fund expenditures Overview of the Basic Financial Statements This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Districts basic financial statements The Districts basic financial statements comprise three components governmentwide financial statements fund financial statements and notes to basic financial statements This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves Governmentwide financial statements The governmentwide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the Districts finances in a manner similar to a privatesector business The statement of net position presents information on all of the Districts assets deferred outflows of resources liabilities and deferred inflows of resources with the difference between these elements as net position Over time increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating The statement of activities presents information showing how the Districts net position changed during the most recent fiscal year All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs regardless of the timing of related cash flows Thus revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Each of the governmentwide financial statements relates to functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues governmental activities The governmental activities of the District are all related to public education The governmentwide financial statements can be found on pages of this report Fund financial statements A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives The District like other state and local governments uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with financerelated legal requirements All of the funds of the District can be divided into three categories governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds Governmental funds Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements However unlike the governmentwide financial statements governmental fund financial statements focus on nearterm inflows and outflows of spendable resources as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year Such information may be useful in evaluating a governments nearterm financing requirements Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the governmentwide financial statements it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements By doing so readers may better understand the longterm impact of the Districts nearterm financing decisions Both the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities The District maintains individual governmental funds In the governmental funds balance sheet and in the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances separate columns are presented for General Fund District Bonds Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund and all other funds Individual account data for all other nonmajor governmental funds are provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this report The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the General Fund to demonstrate compliance with the budget The governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages and of this report Proprietary funds The District maintains Internal Service Funds as the only type of proprietary fund Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the Districts various functions The District uses internal service funds to account for Health and Welfare Benefits Workers Compensation SelfInsurance and Liability SelfInsurance Because all of these services benefit governmental functions they have been included within governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements It is the Districts practice to record estimated claim liabilities at the present value of the claims in conformity with the accrual basis of accounting for all its internal service funds The proprietary fund financial statements can be found on pages of this report Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Fiduciary funds Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the governmentwide financial statements because the resources of those funds are not available to support the Districts own programs The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds The fiduciary fund financial statements can be found on pages of this report Notes to basic financial statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the governmentwide and fund financial statements The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages of this report Combining and individual fund schedules and statements Combining schedules and statements consisting of the budget to actual comparisons for District Bonds Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund the individual accounts within the nonmajor governmental funds the internal service funds and the fiduciary funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information Combining and individual fund schedules and statements can be found on pages of this report Governmentwide Financial Analysis As noted earlier net position over time may serve as a useful indicator of a governments financial position In the case of the District liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources exceeded assets plus deferred outflows of resources by billion at the close of the most recent year The Districts net position reflects its investments in capital assets billion eg land buildings and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding The District uses these capital assets to provide services to students consequently these assets are not available for future spending Although the Districts investments in its capital assets are reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities The Districts restricted net position billion represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used The majority of this pertains to capital projects funds primarily the County School Facilities Bonds Fund and Bond Interest and Redemption Fund The remaining negative balance in unrestricted net position billion resulted primarily from the net pension liability for various retirement plans totaling billion and the net OPEB liability totaling billion At the end of the fiscal year the District is able to report positive balances in all categories of net position except for unrestricted net position The billion increase in net capital assets primarily relates to costs incurred for school construction and modernization projects throughout the District which is higher compared to the recognition of depreciation expense Longterm liabilities decreased by billion primarily due to a decrease in certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable as a result of debt service payments and debt refunding to avail of lower interest rates Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Summary Statements of Net

by billion from the prior year This is primarily due to the Districts implementation of a more costeffective health care plan This resulted in a decrease of billion in the Districts net OPEB liability

Facilities Services Other Uses Operation and Maintenance of Plant Services Support Services Instruction Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Financial Analysis of the Governmental Funds As noted earlier the District uses fund accounting to facilitate compliance with financerelated requirements Governmental funds The focus of the Districts governmental funds is to provide information on nearterm inflows outflows and balances of spendable resources Such information is useful in assessing the Districts financing requirements Committed assigned and unassigned balances comprise the unrestricted fund balances and may serve as a useful measure of the Districts net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year As of the end of the current fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of billion in comparison with the prior year Approximately of this total combined ending fund balance consists of the assigned fund balance totaling billion and nonspendable and restricted fund balances totaling billion which can only be spent for specific purposes because of laws and regulations or grantor restrictions The remaining billion of this total combined ending fund balance constitutes committed fund balance totaling billion which represents commitment for ongoing salary increases of District employees and unassigned fund balance totaling billion which includes spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District At the end of the fiscal year the unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was billion while the total fund balance is billion The fund balance of the Districts General Fund increased by billion during the current fiscal year This is primarily attributable to the overall decrease in spending by the District Other changes in fund balances in the governmental funds are detailed as follows in thousands Other Governmental Funds District Bonds Bond Interest and Redemption Special Revenue Debt Service Other Capital Projects Total Fund Balance June Nonspendable Revolving cash and imprest funds Inventories Prepaids Restricted Assigned Total Fund Balance July Increase decrease in fund balance The fund balance decreased during the current year for the District Bonds due to continued spending for school construction modernization projects and renovation The increase of million in Bond Interest and Redemption was attributable to the increase in property tax levy for local bond debt service Special Revenue also increased primarily due to increase in revenue in the Cafeteria Fund Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June The decrease of billion for the Capital Projects due to spending on projects primarily in the County School Facilities Bonds combined with project cost transfers to other capital project accounts Debt Service decreased slightly due to the release of a debt service reserve fund Proprietary funds The Districts proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the governmentwide financial statements At the end of the year the Districts proprietary funds have an unrestricted net position of billion The net increase of million in the current year is primarily attributed to a net operating margin in the Workers Compensation SelfInsurance Fund and Health and Welfare Benefits Fund The net increase was mainly due to higher interest income and higher contributions to the fund offset by lower expenditures as a result of the Districts implementation of a more costeffective health care plan General Fund Budgetary Highlights Los Angeles Unified School District closely monitors and reviews its revenue and expenditure data to ensure that a sufficient ending balance is maintained This monitoring and review occurs from the development of the budgeted data through the Statemandated first and second interim financial reports and at year end utilizing the actual revenue and expenditure data Modified Final Budget vs Original Final Budget The Districts Original Final Budget which was approved as a revised budget by the Board of Education on October and by the Los Angeles County of Education on November is based on assumptions from the States Enacted Budget while the Modified Final Budget is based not only on the States Enacted Budget but also on all other known State budgetary changes and changes to the Districts priority of program implementations andor planned expenditures since the Original Final Budget Differences between the General Fund Original Final Budget and the Modified Final Budget resulted in a lower budgeted ending balance by billion from billion to billion Adjustments to the Original Final Budget were an increase in beginning balance by million an increase in budgeted revenues and financing sources by billion and an increase in budgeted expenditures and other financing uses by billion The increase in beginning balance by million was due to the reflection of an audit adjustment The net increase in budgeted revenues and other financing sources of billion was mostly due to a higher grant recognition of billion increase in States onbehalf contribution to California State Teachers Retirement System CalSTRS of billion and proceeds from legal settlement of million The change in estimated expenditures and other financing uses of billion was mostly attributable to budget changes to fund salary increases due to collective bargaining agreements of billion to increase grant expenditure authority by billion and States onbehalf contribution to California State Teachers Retirement System CalSTRS by billion due to a higher revenue Actual vs Modified Final Budget The beginning balance remained the same on both the Actual and the Modified Final Budget The unfavorable variance of million in revenues and other financing sources between the Actual and Modified Final Budget was mostly due to adjustments of billion on multiyear grants which are budgeted in their entirety but earned only to the extent of actual expenditures incurred The lower recognition of grant amounts are offset by increased Local Control Funding Formula LCFF revenue of million resulting from adjustments in the prior year Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June funded Average Daily Attendance ADA higher Other State Revenue of million mostly from State Lottery and Special Education apportionment attributable to changes in funded Average Daily Attendance ADA and allocation rates improved interest income of million brought about by higher interest rate and cash balance and the recognition of eminent domain settlement amount received from Los Angeles World Airport Agency LAWA of million The favorable variance of billion in expenditures and other financing uses between the Actual and the Modified Final Budget was mostly from school carryover accounts The unspent portion of these school accounts will be carried over into the next fiscal year to pay for future obligations The largest decreases in expenditures were mainly in Books and Supplies billion Certificated Salaries billion and Services and Other Operating Expenditures billion Differences between the Actual and Modified Final Budget resulted in a higher ending balance by billion from billion to billion Capital Assets and Debt Administration Capital assets The Districts investment in capital assets for its governmental activities as of June amounts to billion net of accumulated depreciation increase from the prior year The investment in capital assets includes sites improvement of sites buildings and improvements equipment and construction in progress net of any related accumulated depreciation The increase is primarily due to various Americans with Disabilities Act ADA improvement seismic heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC and comprehensive modernization projects at school sites Summary of capital assets net of accumulated depreciation is as follows in thousands Governmental Activities Sites Improvement of sites Buildings and improvements Equipment Construction in progress Total Additional information on the Districts capital assets can be found in Note on pages of this report Longterm obligations At the end of the current fiscal year the District had total longterm obligations of billion Of this amount billion comprises of debt to be repaid by voterapproved property taxes and not by the General Fund of the District Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Summary of longterm obligations is as follows in thousands Governmental Activities General Obligation Bonds Certificates of Participation COPs Capital Lease Obligations Childrens Center Facilities Revolving Loan Liability for Compensated Absences Liability for Other Employee Benefits Selfinsurance Claims Net Pension Liability OPEB Arbitrage Payable Total The Districts total longterm obligations decreased by billion during the current fiscal year The decrease was primarily due to the Districts implementation of a more costeffective health care plan In addition certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable decreased as a result of debt service payments and debt refunding to avail of lower interest rates LongTerm Credit Ratings Below are the Districts longterm credit ratings as of June from rating agencies that carry ratings on all or some of the Districts outstanding GO bonds and COPs issued Moodys Investors Service Moodys rated the Districts GO bonds and COPs as Aa and A respectively with a Stable Outlook Fitch Ratings

accompanying basic financial statements a Reporting Entity The District is primarily responsible for all activities related to K public education in most of the western section of Los Angeles County State of California The governing authority as designated by the State Legislature consists of seven elected officials who together constitute the Board of Education Board Those organizations

statements and governmentwide statements which are intended to provide an overall viewpoint of the Districts finances The governmentwide financial statements which are the statement of net position and the statement of activities report information on all nonfiduciary District funds excluding the effect of interfund activities Governmental activities which are normally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues are reported separately from businesstype activities which are primarily supported by fees and service charges The District does not conduct any businesstype activities The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function Program revenues include charges to customers or applicants who purchase use or directly benefit from goods services or privileges provided by a given function and grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function Taxes and other items not properly included among program revenues are reported as general revenues Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds even though the latter are excluded from the governmentwide financial statements Major individual governmental funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements on pages and Nonmajor funds are aggregated in a single column c Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting The governmentwide financial statements are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting as are the proprietary and trust funds Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when the liability is incurred regardless of the timing of related cash flows The agency funds report only assets and liabilities and therefore have no measurement focus Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting Revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual ie both measurable and available to finance expenditures of the fiscal period Available means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay current liabilities Application of the susceptibility to accrual criteria requires consideration of the materiality of the item in question and due regard for the practicality of accrual as well as consistency in application Federal revenues and State apportionments and allowances are determined to be available and measurable when entitlement occurs or related eligible expenditures are incurred Secured and unsecured property taxes related to debt service and community redevelopment purposes that are estimated to be collectible and receivable within days of the current period are recorded as revenue Investment income is accrued when earned All other revenues are not considered susceptible to accrual Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Notes to Basic Financial Statements Year

assumptions Valuation Date Experience Study Actuarial Cost Method Investment Rate of Return Consumer Price Inflation Wage Growth Postretirement Benefit Increases June July through June Entry age normal simple for defined benefit annually maintain purchasing power level for defined benefit not applicable for Defined Benefit Supplement Net of investment expenses but gross of administrative expenses Discount Rate The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability of the CalSTRS TRF was The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members and employers will be made at statutory contribution rates Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the longterm assumed investment rate of return and assuming that contributions and benefit payments and administrative expenses occur mid year Based on those assumptions the CalSTRS TRF fiduciary net pension was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members Therefore the longterm assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability The longterm expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building block method in which bestestimate ranges of expected future real rates of return expected returns net of pension plan investment expense and inflation are developed for each major asset class The best estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from CalSTRS general investment consultant Pension Consulting AlliancePCA as inputs to the process The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the Board in February in conjunction with the most recent experience study For each future valuation CalSTRS consulting actuary Milliman reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions Best

for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is available the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first When an expenditure is incurred for which amounts in any of the unrestricted classifications of fund balance could be used the District considers assigned amounts to be reduced first before the unassigned amounts Minimum Fund Balance Policy As part of the Budget and Finance Policy the governing board has adopted a minimum fund balance policy for the General Fund in order to avoid the need for service level reductions in the event that an economic downturn causes revenues to be substantially lower than what was budgeted The policy requires the District to maintain a reserve for economic uncertainty consisting of unassigned amounts equal to at least of total General Fund expenditures and other financing uses In the event that the District must expend all or part of this reserve the District will identify and implement a budgetary plan to replenish this reserve the following year This reserve may be adjusted based on changes to legal requirement It is also a policy that the total General Fund balance be maintained at a minimum level of of total General Fund expenditures and Other Financing Uses In the event that the General Fund balance falls below this level all onetime monies will be setaside until the minimum reserve threshold is met In

from the Districts Dependent Charter School were reported as Free or Reduced or English Learner eligible but were unsupported as Free or Reduced or English Learner eligible The cause of the error in reporting into CALPADS stems from the District handling multiple sets of datarecords which reports the eligibility of students This process has led to these students initially being reported as Free

planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the Los Angeles Unified School District District as of and for the year ended June in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America we considered the Districts internal control over financial reporting internal control as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control Accordingly we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified Given these limitations during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses However material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified Although not considered to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses we also noted certain items during our audit which we would like to bring to your attention These comments are summarized in the following report to management on page Our observations and recommendations have been discussed with appropriate members of management and are intended to strengthen internal controls and operating efficiency SIMPSON SIMPSONCertified Public

Record Access Condition Four payroll personnel have access to create a vendor and changeupdate a vendor within the SAP accounting payable module using the Create Vendor FK and the Change Vendor FK transactions respectively We were informed by ITD that to remit garnishment withholdings the above payroll personnel are required to establish the employee with garnishment as a vendor within SAPs accounts payable module However this condition adversely impacts maintaining adequate segregation of duties Recommendation The creation and changeupdate of a vendor accountrecord for a garnishment recipientpayee should be migrated to the Procurement department as they are the owner of the Create Vendor FK transaction and data Management Response Payroll Services will work with Procurement Services to transition the responsibility of creating and maintaining vendor accounts for garnishment recipients ITD will assist in this effort by providing the appropriate security roles and working with Payroll to implement a process to ensure Payroll has the necessary garnishment information to run payroll efficiently without delays ML Process Timekeeping Access Condition Our review of access to the Process Timekeeping CAT production transactions revealed five retiree personnel with access to the Process Timekeeping CAT production transaction We were informed that removing CAT access for these retirees was missed due to a GRC Governance Risk Compliance system malfunction However a time expiration date was placed on these users accounts subsequent to auditor notification Also as their respective SSO Single Sign On network access was deleted upon their termination the risk of unauthorized access by these individuals is reduced Recommendation SAP transaction access for terminated users eg Retirees should be removed or expired in a timely manner The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments Management Response An automated process is in place to remove SAP roles from retirees and separated employees in a timely manner This condition occurred due to a break in the process caused by two GRC change requests Upon notification SAP Security Team proceeded to date delimit the SAP user master record of these users and confirmed that these employees SSO account was deactivated once they were separated Even though they had PA access they cannot log into SAP This system defect has been addressed and resolved The two change requests that caused a breakfix in the process were SharePoint request Update

cid cid cidcidcidcidcidcidcidcidcidcidcidcidcid CTech is built on the MultiTier System of Supports MTSS which encompasses a Response to Intervention RtI program but goes beyond the student interventions MTSS addresses academic as well as the social emotional and behavioral development of children from early childhood to promotion It provides multiple levels of support for all learners below grade level to above grade level CTech will align resources and support for students receiving instruction and for teachers and other support staff who are delivering the instruction

knowledge is ever growing and so while FOSS will serve as a foundation to our science program we will also partner with the vibrant technology and science community only available in Pasadena as we work to build an experiential curriculum with community partners For example we are partnering with a local Pasadena company which manufactures robotic arms for use on the Mars Rover and other deep space projects to share with our students knowledge about the solar system deep space and simple engineering principles

Westmont home to about residents is a vibrant and dynamic multicultural community however a majority of the population has been marginalized by larger societal and economic forces From CityDatacom it reports that in the median household income in Westmont is less than half of that in the state of California In this community of the residents are in poverty and of households are on public assistance With rising housing costs food and healthcare in Southern California this makes community residents extremely vulnerable to future shifts in the economy In addition of births in South Los Angeles were from mothers who were years old Thus given the large percentage of teenage mothers and singleheaded households many parents struggle to even provide basic needs for their children In Westmont of residents are native Spanish speakers Therefore the language needs of all students will need to be explicitly addressed to ensure their academic success Such language diversity will add to the rich cultural experiences for CTech students and reinforces the need for a culturally relevant pedagogy that both prepares students for English language proficiency and celebrates the richness of students native languages Westmont has also been identified by the LA Times as one of the deadliest neighborhoods in Los Angeles County According to recent reports in February a year was shot and

professional development for all stakeholders Resources and funding AEA Advisory for African American Students How CTech Meets the Needs of the Community CTech designed in deep partnership with community Philosophically we do not believe in designing school models in a vacuum and then finding a neighborhood in which to deploy them a line of thinking that unfortunately is too common in the public education space and often leads to undersupported and underenrolled schools Instead we follow a Neighborhood First approach rooted in the core tenants of design thinking Understanding the dreams and challenges faced by students parents and community leaders through empathy interviews and organized events Examining the impact of race and implicit bias on communities and schools and building the cultural competency of our leaders Envisioning what Los Angeles is going to look like in so that we can identify the skills habits and signature learning experiences that future high school graduates will need to be ready for college career and life Piloting prototyping and building community relationships by running popup schools a series of meetups workshops and events designed to listen test assumptions and ideas gather community feedback and build an authentic base of supporters A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology CTech began conducting this work in more than two years in advance of the Charter School authorization process so that the Charter School is codesigned with the community partners Community Engagement Efforts CTech was born from families and community members demanding a school and a set of learning experiences that would excite their children and prepare them for college and the workforce of the future In conjunction with Pastor DK Redmond at Sunnyside Baptist Church th St and Budlong Ave the founding team began working in Westmont in March leading a School Hack Challenge ie a Shark Tank for kids The success of this event led to community requests to continue the work which CTech did in the form of a Coding Camp in Summer and later a Robotics Camp in Summer At West Angeles Church in the Crenshaw community the founding team led a Parent Design Workshop in December attended by parents to collect feedback on the school model design Beyond expressing frustration at the chronic underperformance of local public schools these parents expressed extreme interest in schools that prepared students for future tech careers college and entrepreneurship They also expressed concerns around race and socioeconomic issues and want schools where their children can thrive have appropriate social emotional supports and not feel pressured by the color of their skin To further test the future tech focus requested by these parents CTech has led several Youth and Tech camps in partnership with Girls Club of Los Angeles focused on coding app development and entrepreneurship at Helen Keller Park in South Los Angeles These camps have allowed the team to test aspects of the CTech model learn and then iterate based on feedback students have attended these events As a result of these popup school efforts Pastor Redmond parents and local community members requested that a techthemed school paired with effective social emotional learning strategies be opened to improve the life outcomes of both children and adults in the community CTech is a response to this request The community engagements efforts continue The team serves as active listeners and participants at neighborhood gatherings and celebrations such as the First LA Fair and the Community Coalition South LA Powerfest With each event the base of local support continues to grow and the team continues to iterate based on a foundation of feedback from actual students and families Locals refer to the Westmont neighborhood as Death Alley as in recent years it has had the highest murders in one square mile in all the United States Cruz Many of the young men become involved with gangs and drugrelated crimes at an early age The community is in dire need of a school that will radically change outcomes for all youth as well as adults Thus CTech has been inspired to codesign a learning model that leverages the assets of the community supports an entrepreneurial spirit and provides social emotional supports and interventions so that students can thrive CTech believes inschool learning time is critical as are supportive adult relationships Approximately parents have signed in support of CTech and we will continue to partner A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology with the Los Angeles County of Parks and Recreation Girls Club of Los Angeles

and world atlarge In addition we have built in a A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology researchedbased social emotional framework the Comer Model that supports the academic success of atrisk youth of color in high poverty communities CTech will meet the needs of the community serve the intent of the California Charter Schools Act as well as the Districts mission vision and strategic goals CTech will help accomplish the intent of the California Charter Schools Act as follows a Improve pupil learning A school structure and curriculum that are responsive to student needs researchbased instructional methods the hiring and ongoing of training of teachers enthusiastically committed to CTechs vision and increased student participation in creative innovations and technology are some of the Charter Schools key characteristics that will improve pupil learning at the Charter School b Increase learning opportunities for all pupils with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for pupils who are identified as academically low achieving While any student can enroll in CTech to take advantage of its distinctive learning opportunities the Charter School targets a student population that has typically been primarily academically low achieving in noncharter public schools c Encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods Few schools serving low socioeconomic status areas have succeeded in achieving a truly progressive instructional approach eg the use of Computational Thinking Individualized Learning and Development Plans Comer Model and Caring School Community curriculum embedded with the State Standards in authentic relevant contexts an emphasis on content application and development of higher order thinking skills student voice and strong socialemotional skill development It is the aim of CTech to hire staff who believe wholeheartedly in giving students a sense of purpose meaning and voice and who use the curriculum as a means to provide an educational experience that is transformative for the student and ultimately for the greater community d Create new professional opportunities for teachers including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the school site There are few opportunities for teachers committed to serving typically academically lowachieving students in low socioeconomic areas with progressive educational methods e Provide parents and pupils with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available within the public school system As described above CTech will provide parents with a choice that is currently not available to most f Hold the schools established under this part accountable for meeting measurable pupil outcomes and provide the schools with a method to change from rulebased to performancebased accountability systems whereby many sections of the California Education Code are waived for charter schools but they can be closed for not performing This goal is achieved through charter school legislation and reflected in Elements and of this petition g Provide vigorous competition within the public school system to stimulate continual improvements in all public schools This goal is also embedded in the structure of Charter Schools by allowing alternatives like CTech to exist and exemplify effective practices that other public schools may wish to emulate CTech is committed to fulfill the Districts mission to embrace the diversity to educate LAs youth ensure academic achievement and empower tomorrows leaders as previously described A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology in CTechs discussion of meeting the needs

positive effects on students in charter schools math and reading scores across a twoyear period compared to their district counterparts The results are promising particularly for the lowest performing students CTechs approach draws on this research and includes tailoring instruction to address each individual students needs interests and skills In addition CTech will incorporate and extend strategies as outlined in the Gates Foundation report Blended Learning for Targeted Instruction CTechs instructional program uses blended learning strategies Lisa Delpit argued that students especially those who are typically underserved by public schools must have explicit instruction on skills and skills development Students must be able to work independently and with their peers to complete complex tasks We believe that moving beyond books through online curriculum is a critical supportintervention that will accelerate student learning STEAM Centered ProjectBased learning to empower student passions and a love of learning Project based learning provides high levels of engagement for learners of varied ability levels and from diverse backgrounds Students who struggle in traditional instructional settings may excel when working on a project because the inquirybased and collaborative setting better matches their learning style At the family level parents will be provided with written information about each SEL module This information will include suggestions and activities for incorporating SEL at home Community level strategies will include collaboration with community organizations to further promote the tenets of SEL Systemic SEL instruction and activities at multiple levels will allow for skills to be taught modeled rehearsed and adapted to multiple situations so that students can fluidly incorporate them into their daily activities At CTech we take an inquirybased approach to learning and problem solving Middle school students will receive a curriculum with a rigorous humanities and STEAM Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics focus Our teachers focus on collaborative design and work to create an interdisciplinary curriculum where topics are integrated across academic subjects Computational Thinking to prepare students for the workforce of the future In response to the everchanging future of technology and

achievement and overall wellbeing SEL can be viewed as a protective mechanism that buffers students exposed to risk factors from engaging in maladaptive behaviorsDurlak and his colleagues state that it is the integration of frameworks that enhance academic performance with those that promote youth development by creating protection and fostering positive adjustment CTech will implement SEL using the Caring School Community curriculum which has been proven to increase SEL and academic outcomes for atrisk students in California Fostering Growth Mindsets A central component of how students think and learn involves their beliefs about intelligence If students believe that intelligence is malleable they are said to have an incremental or a growth mindset Those who have more fixed ideas or endorse the idea that it is innate tend to be more vulnerable to negative feedback and have performance as opposed to learning goals Whereas those with intelligence beliefs that can change may perform better on problemsolving and cognitive tasks Teachers will be trained to foster a growth mindset in students through shortterm interventions giving students a sense of control over the learning process using strategiesapproaches that include problembased learning independent study research apprenticeships Also in teachers everyday interactions with students they will foster growth mindsets in culturally specific ways For example it is suggested that teachers not attribute academic successes to ability in the general population However Professor Luke Wood argues that because African American and Latino student consistently questioned and undermined they need to be told they have the ability and that it can be enhanced Community building to empower parents to support the academic success of students We bring together the community to promote social emotional and physical health Every summer we lead events supported by the community Students will be required to complete hours of community service before they graduate Teamwork and collaboration is critical to the culture of CTech and the success of each student It is essential that we build a culture of respect amongst students teachers and school leadership Parent Engagement is a Critical component as our students will be several grade levels behind Research has shown that parent engagement can improve attendance

EMPOWERED CREATIVITY Creative genius isnt rare but the conditions that nurture it are Krueger CTech will be a place that nurtures every childs unique genius Each student will have multiple opportunities to solve problems in their communities using technology and draw on their interests experiences and strengths Our students may decide like Hannah the yearold whose story was documented in the Empowered Learner magazine grew tired of going to the emergency room each time she had an asthma attack She was able to design and D print a prototype for a handheld device that could measure her lung capacity in real time Other students like Chance a year old who attended one of our app development bootcamps in the community we plan to serve wanted to get PC parts at a discount and created an app prototype that would make these parts available to others Still others like Sariah an year old from our camp wanted to learn about Africa so she created a web application that would allow users to explore the histories cultures and geography of countries in Africa She noticed she did not come across this information in her school so she wanted to make it available for herself and interested others Design thinking to empower students to build create and prototype solutions to problems We support freedom and expression of ideas and we invest in them Often schools are designed with a onesize fits all mentality But through our portfolio defense entrepreneurship lab media arts extracurriculars we encourage students to pursue their passions and design a unique experience for them during their years at CTech We want students and teachers to be excited about coming to school everyday Design thinking schools to address learning issues and curriculum design We will measure and track students growth in creativity using the VIA IS assessment Entrepreneurial mindset to empower students to lead in their communities and the st century workforce At CTech we plan to foster a spirit of collaboration risk taking creativity and problem solving All students will be required to take Entrepreneurship Lab before they complete grade Students will be scheduled to take Entrepreneurship Lab in grade which will occur in the second term of the Charter They will use design thinking strategies and computational thinking to solve real world problems and build innovative solutions They will be judged by how well they can build scale and market any innovative solution to a problem They may build a product business or nonprofit organization This experience is modeled

Learning and Development Plan ILDP The ILDP includes the individual strengths academic and social emotional learning goals and progress of each child Teachers will use the data in the ILDP to leverage students strengths and experiences to enhance learning During the first advisory meeting of each semester teachers and students set goals and track progress towards those goals throughout the year The ILDP is also shared with and signed off by parents The ILDP sets students up early for college and career readiness at a young age The plan will include examples of students projects prototypes code writing quizzes D printed objects business plans websites research designs test scores and grades The ILDP will be accessible via Google Classroom so that teachers and students may update throughout the year Students will be taught explicitly by teachers in Grades TK how to develop and compose goals and action plans They will also be taught methods to reflect on their progress and amend their action plans Teachers will model successful ILDPs by providing options and choices for students to consider the next reasonable steps to achieve their goals and will monitor the students journey towards reaching their targets The planning process will help students learn how to prioritize organize and make productive decisions about their learning paths Stanford K Lab httpsdschoolstanfordeduprogramsklabnetwork A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Students are promoted from the primary grades through the

Academic Skills b Character EducationBehavioral Dispositions c ProjectBased Learning d Short and Longterm Interests e Capstone Project ii Capstone Projects All students will complete a Capstone Project before matriculating from th grade at CTech These projects will emerge from the Entrepreneurship Lab which will be a business or organization that the student envisions tests and develops This project must meet these standards to be deemed a success The idea must be original and originated by the student The idea must solve a problem faced by more than one person The idea must use an innovative technological solution to the problem The student must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the problem faced by their specific market The idea or solution must be validated through market testing and The student must present hisher idea articulately to an audience of their peers andor expert advisors All of these project features will be introduced and practiced many times through the students years at CTech Students will also be able to draw upon the advice of their teachers and the mentorship of advisors B Blended Learning CTechs instructional program uses blended learning strategies Lisa Delpit argued that students especially those who are typically underserved by public schools must have explicit instruction on skills and skills development Students must be able to work independently and with their peers to complete complex tasks We believe that moving beyond books through online curriculum is a critical supportintervention that will accelerate student learning Blended learning strategies are designed to increase fluency with core subject matter concepts for all students After various levels of direct instruction students will rotate among oneonone digital instruction guided small group instruction and peerbased small group assignments This approach provides many points of access to concepts for students with diverse learning styles opportunities for reflection and deepening understanding while teaching staff intervene or enrich in real time CTech teachers will implement blended learning rotation models at least three days Delpit Lisa Lessons from Teachers Journal of Teacher Education A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology a week in both core and noncore subjects that blend traditional and innovative learning methods to accommodate the learning needs of diverse students i Station Rotation Model Grades TKK In the Station Rotation model students rotate through stations on a fixed schedule where at least one of the stations is an online learning station The elementary grades will engage in a threepronged station rotation model blending teacherled instruction online instruction and collaborative STEAM based project activities a Example of an English Language Arts Lesson for rd grade students The objective for the week is to ask and answer questions to demonstrate understanding of a text referring explicitly to the text as the basis for the answers For the first half hour all students convene for whole group instruction in the first station to review key skills and engage in a teacherled class discussion Students then split into two groups and join one of the other two stations each for a half hour The teacher andor teaching assistant rotates to each station supporting student needs Students logon to GoogleClassroom to view their assignments In the online learning station students independently review a text using Achieve software and complete an assessment demonstrating mastery In the STEAMbased PBL station students work on writing a short essay about what career they want to pursue when they grow up which will be included as a part of a published online classroom blog due at the end of the week Students will review one of their peers essays offer comments and answer questions posed by the teacher citing the text to support their answers ii Flex Rotation Model Grades thth The Flex Rotation model supports students to function more independently progressing on flexible schedules among learning activities according to their needs Online learning is the backbone of student learning in a Flex model Teachers provide support and instruction on a flexible asneeded basis while students work through course curriculum and content This model gives students a high degree of control over their learning Teachers will assess student mastery using JumpRope a standardsbased teaching and learning platform Students meet each week to set SMART goals aligned to their ILDPs and complete formative assessments to track mastery of common core aligned learning objectives a Example of a Math Lesson for th grade students The standard for the week is to find the area of right triangles other triangles special quadrilaterals and polygons by composing into rectangles or decomposing into triangles and other shapes apply these techniques in the context of solving realworld and mathematical problems Students will logon to JumpRope and review the assignments the teacher has created for the week Throughout the class period the teacher andor teaching assistant rotates to each station supporting individual student needs One assignment involves students completing three online courses focused on area from Khan Academy where they must demonstrate at least mastery Their next assignment may involve participating in a student led Socratic discussion where the group reads and discusses a text on the history of the Pythagorean theorem and each student A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology writes a onepage reflection on its impact in modern times Finally their STEAMbased project is to work in teams with other students to approximate the area of the school building The team must submit a diagram a video narrative and written mathematical solution to the problem On Friday all teams present their projects to the class Blended learning will serve CTechs diverse student population well allowing for personalization and differentiated instruction Blended learning environments have been proven to help bridge the academic achievement gap experienced by English Learners as demonstrated by proven success in districts such as the Round Rock ISD Online or softwarebased learning programs can give English Learners the ability to read and hear the instruction often at the same time while utilizing their schema to help create connections between the English words and their meaning Even if the student is struggling to understand the words of the instruction he or she can see and hear the visualauditory cues and utilize their context clues to help grasp the concepts and the verbiage The adaptive technology component within CTechs online learning programs eg ST Math allows for students to progress to higher levels and objectives at their own pace to achieve proficiency Using diagnostic assessment results teachers will set up students to work on objectives that are appropriate to their level thus essentially providing every child a virtual tutor to help himher move as quickly or slowly as their performance dictates Moreover the ability of software and online learning tools to frequently assess student progress gives teachers realtime information about whether a student is mastering a concept or requires additional teacher attention and instruction Blended learning strategies are designed to increase fluency with core subject matter concepts for all students After various levels of direct instruction students will rotate among oneonone digital instruction guided small group instruction and peerbased small group assignments This approach provides many points of access to concepts for students with diverse learning styles opportunities for reflection and deepening understanding while teaching staff intervene or enrich in real time C STEAM Centered ProjectBased Learning CTechs projectbased curriculum will be structured to allow students to pursue individual educational goals while at the same time requiring them to collaborate with others on a shared objective Classroom learning is organized in meaningful purposeful ways though rich cross disciplinary subject matter that corresponds to State Standards CTechs STEAMbased project based learning PBL helps students develop the character habits and skills vital to our st century workforce CTech teachers will collaboratively identify projects that challenge students to work individually or in groups to create plans solve problems they encounter test their ideas Raise Your Hand Texas httpswwwraiseyourhandtexasorgfoundationblendedblendedinactionroundrock isd A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology and present their projects to peers The effectiveness of the PBL implementation will be assessed by analyzing teacher and student engagement In the real world concepts from math science English Language Arts history technology engineering and the arts often intersect Through PBL students will participate in cross disciplinary projects that integrate core subjects mirroring what they will find in the real world This will give students opportunities to lead teams and create artifacts of social value Diverse projects will enable students to learn via active engagement and doing Through PBL our students will engage in complex and challenging tasks and problemsolving both independently and in small groups engaging in a depth of learning that creates true understanding beyond rote memorization of facts We will infuse PBL into all of our core subject matters English Language Arts Mathematics Social Studies and Science Instruction For example students who are studying physical science may have a project to develop a school garden learn the life cycle of plants and write an essay about their experience Skills students need to learn through a standards based curriculum will be taught explicitly and monitored through student application in PBL units of study Teachers will draw from researchbased PBL resources including the Stanford K Lab and TeachEngineering from the University of Colorado Our projectbased environment structures learning around goals and guiding activities a variety of resources eg museums libraries Internet videos lectures and time for students to share reflect and apply resources participation structures and classroom norms that increase the use of evidence and a culture of collaboration formative assessments that evaluate soft skills such as emotional regulation and social participation as well as harder conceptual skills that provide opportunities for reflection and revision and summative assessments supporting students to take initiative to promote their own progress i Goals of CTech PBL Lessons Through projects teachers will be able to accomplish a number of objectives in an engaging relevant way for students of all ages so that they Acquire communicate and investigate knowledge as connected to other knowledge domains their own lives and the world at large Instead of dividing instruction into disconnected learning blocks students will be able to view school subjects as connected and interrelated much like real life As students will explore topics in a variety of ways and through various sources and learn to relate what they are learning to their own lives When students view their learning as having personal relevance they put more effort into their schoolwork and achievement Activities will be assigned for home exploration that will help students bridge school learning and their lives at home with the intent of helping students develop problemsolving and decisionmaking skills Integrate reading writing listening speaking and thinking across the curriculum Extensive research documents the power of reading and writing across the curriculum to create active readers and writers by engaging students in authentic literacy tasks that emerge naturally from interesting and worthwhile topics and ideas As such each project will emphasize CCSS Literacy across subject areas Narrative and expository literature and high interest trade books will serve as key resources for Vogt M CrossCurricular Thematic Instruction httpswwweduplacecomrdgresvogthtml A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology thematic instruction As noted by the current California Science Standards Framework Effective science programs use standardsbased connections with other core subjects to reinforce science teaching and learning Reading writing mathematics and speaking skills are all needed to learn and do science In selfcontained classrooms teachers incorporate science content in reading writing and mathematics Make choices interact collaborate and cooperate Students will explore topics individually in small groups and together as a whole class As part of their project work they will research and discover new knowledge evaluate that knowledge and make critical choices to synthesize that knowledge into the required artifact They will then work with their teachers to evaluate their choices and their collaboration to improve either in extensions to that assignment or in future assignments In doing so they will develop selfreliance a powerful intuition and team management skills This will occur by teachers being intentional about choosing projects that lend themselves to individual and group instruction as well as dedicating the time needed for students to work in groups of their peers and teaching staff Participate and learn regardless of ability level of language development or background An advantage of projectbased instruction is that it provides opportunities for teachers to implement a variety of instructional approaches that best meet the students where they are in their conceptual intellectual social and emotional development For example while some students may need extra practice with developing a problemsolving strategy other students may need additional time for discovery or independent research Project based learning allows students to individually construct their own path to a solution from start to finish Further it allows students to collectively address their weaknesses while learning from each other Finally it also provides the opportunity for the teacher to act as guide and model a variety of successful approaches ii The Sources of CTech Project Based Lessons The Projectbased lessons will come from resources such as the Stanford University K Lab and TeachEngineering which both offer commoncore Next Generation Science Standards NGSS aligned curricula Teacher will collaboratively design project based lessons during weekly professional development sessions Evaluation of Projects Each project selected will come with a teacherdesigned evaluation rubric This rubric will be used to evaluate The process used to develop an answer to the problem Levels of collaboration if project is groupbased The students recorded evaluations of their emotional management The creativity of their problemsolving approach The completeness of their solution iii Selection of CTech PBL Lessons California Science Framework httpswwwcdecagovcisccfcascienceframeworkasp A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology CTechs highly engaging projectbased learning model will emphasize the Cs of st Century Learning communication collaboration creativity and critical thinking and problemsolving abilities crucial for success in secondary school college and the global workforce We believe that this engagement and opportunity for truly deep understanding will inspire our students and motivate them to deepen their learning and skills for learning The Cs will be operationalized through a teachers choice of an age appropriate project Projects will be chosen using stringent criteria The project addresses a problem requiring a critical evaluation of the question at hand and the means of solution The project solution and artifacts produced will require applying models to solve and thereby be creative The projects will provide the opportunity to communicate with peers and organize small groups to solve the problem This should not be read to imply that all projects will be group projects only that many projects will be collaborative and The project artifacts will require communication of not just the solution to the problem but the means towards solving the problem iv PBL in our Daily Schedule We anticipate that all core subjects will include at least one Project Based lesson per week The Project Based lesson will occur during the individual full class small group instruction or the group project rotation of the class The teacher will determine when students during an instructional block will work on their project Students will often be encouraged to work on their projects at home Through their home visits teachers will be keenly aware if a students home is conducive for study and suggest accommodations for families to meet the students needs v Realworld Engagement A key feature of CTech is its approach to how it builds on students existing experience and knowledge CTech encourages a high degree of student involvement both imaginatively and in practical problem solving Drawing on the curriculum using the environment and social subjects as a stimulus to explore wonder and make meaning in the context of the students lived experiences To enhance students learning required participation in experiential learning opportunities will be a central aspect of the way in which students learn Engaging with the world and connecting time and place is deeply embedded in the projectbased learning approach of the school Students will not be limited to their own communities for learning and engaging but a variety of methods to bring the world to CTech Rotating real word installations of art science and more in the form of weekly talk to an expert sessions virtual reality experiences international partnerships with students in schools around the world and working with STEM professionals to provide student input to new discoveries and challenges CTech has partnered with STEAMCoders Women in Technology Hollywood Girls Club of Los Angeles and the Artificial Intelligence Los Angeles AILA groups to connect with STEM professionals D Social and Emotional Learning A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology A key component of the Social Emotional Learning Framework is the Advisory Course through which we will implement the Caring School Community SEL program i Advisory Course Advisory Courses will take place in the morning as an energizing way to start the day build a strong sense of community and set students up for success socially and academically During morning meetings students and advisors will meet for minutes and interact with one another in the context of four components Greeting Everyone learns to look at and greet one another by name and practices critical listening and empathy Sharing Students share information about important events in their lives Listeners offer empathetic comments andor ask clarifying questions Lesson Direct lessons of social skills to include learning and following classroom and school rules and procedures selfmanagement skills to include reflecting on personal behavior and asking for help when needed interpersonal skills to include including and sharing work equitably and executive function skills to include monitoring attention and refocusing attention when needed Mindfulness Students and staff practice a mindfulness activity that reinforces engaged learning presence of mind that is crafted to help students focus on the learning that they will do in school that day Optimistic Closure Student and staff will close the daily Advisory experience in an intentional way as they highlight their individual and shared understanding of the importance of the work and can provide a sense of accomplishment and support forwardthinking The optimistic closure may be reflective of the learning help identify next steps or make connections to ones own work Advisory will serve as a safe place to build trusting relationships academic mindset health and wellness and st Century skills CTechs advisory course will foster personalization for each student and aims to teach socialemotional skills in addition to the following Set and track progress towards goals for Individual Learning and Development Plans ILDP Provide developmental guidance formal and informal Foster communication between peers staff and others Encourage supportive peer relationships Practice conflict resolutions Promote collaboration effective listening and problem solving Prepare and support students for daily transitions and life transitions like elementary to middle school middle school to high school high school to college and career Promote character development and explore moral and societal dilemmas Develop crossage buddy activities which allows students to work together with older or younger students in other grades to develop a schoolwide culture and community Host weekly class meetings to address common concerns and current issues Provide weekly Home Connection Activities to help students talk with family members about the social development focus of the week A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Curriculum and Instruction A English Language Arts Core Subject The English Language Arts curriculum for all grade levels at CTech is aligned to the Common Core State Standards and aims to cultivate literacy through a cohesive comprehensive and progressive learning sequence The curriculum balances oral and written language and encompasses all ELA foundations including reading writing speaking and listening Students at CTech learn to read critically analyze text thoughtfully write clearly and purposefully as well as use academically relevant listening and speaking skills in a wide variety of contexts Connected to these purposes is the interdisciplinary expectation that the development of each students literacy skills is a shared responsibility Every teacher at CTech works collaboratively to develop the reading writing speaking and listening skills of all students ELA curriculum as with all courses at CTech is delivered in fully inclusive classrooms in which learners of all abilities

Reading Lab is a skills class designed to assist middle school students in improving their reading comprehension and vocabulary through lab work Teachers assess all students at the beginning middle and end of year to measure their reading skills and apply the appropriate interventions and technology tools Reading Labs are held for onehour periods each day In the Reading Lab students will read nonfiction texts independently as well as engage in small group and oneonone instruction with a certified reading specialist The lab provides students with individual reading tasks designed for additional practice and mastery of concepts presented in A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology class The lab includes computers books and workbooks which cover a variety of reading skills and levels Reading instruction offered in our ELA instructional block incorporates four main components Shared Reading Guided Reading Letter and Word Study and Independent Reading Within this framework teachers are able to incorporate different strategies and approaches daily in order to meet the diverse needs of students Students will receive direct instruction work with partners and small groups working on PBL units and engage in independent work all of which provide for multi level learning Teachers will explicitly teach reading comprehension skills and strategies and then provide authentic opportunities for students to practice throughout the rotational ELA instructional block described above As students progress reading instruction will focus on reading to learn rather than learning to read though CTech recognizes that many students will struggle with the demands of grade level text To address this differentiated instruction will be provided through rotating small group instruction in which students will apply learned skills to text at their independent reading level and will receive systematic decoding and fluency instruction if appropriate Teachers the Resource Specialist and Paraprofessionals all work to move struggling students towards grade level reading proficiency Shared Reading Focusing on comprehension teachers will choose text for a particular purpose and then demonstrate using and applying a particular comprehension strategy In the early grades shared reading may focus heavily on applying decoding strategies in addition to those used to construct meaning Texts used may include big books trade books decodable texts magazines and newspapers anthologies poems and selections from social studies and science texts During shared reading teachers will model the appropriate use of strategies by employing think alouds to allow students the chance to explicitly learn what is generally a more implicit process Students will be given the appropriate vocabulary to identify the strategies they are learning and using and teachers will reinforce and encourage students to share their thinking processes metacognition and articulate what strategies they are using Teachers might also teach particular comprehension skills during shared reading by demonstrating the use of a specific graphic organizer such as a Venn Diagram to compare and contrast Guided Reading Teachers will target instruction based on the individual needs of students through guided reading As a whole class reading instruction might be focused on the reading strategy of asking questions During guided reading time the teacher will choose texts that provide opportunities to guide students in the use of this strategy based on the appropriate instructional levels of individual students Students will all be working on the same objective but using different texts for example texts related to projects students are working on in other subject matters At other times reading groups might be working on different strategies again based on need Because students are more likely to reveal questions tentative hypotheses A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology inferences and connections to past learning in small groups rather than in front of the whole class teachers will regularly observe and assess the reading habits and progress of students In the upper grades in addition to guided reading teachers will employ literature circles and discussion groups Both of these activities encourage student exploration of complex themes in text enhance oral language and higherlevel cognition provide a chance for students to freely explore ideas and deepen students understanding of what they read while creating more enthusiastic and engaged readers The cooperative and heterogeneous grouping practices used in these activities are also beneficial to English Learners who may be less hesitant to practice and perform in smaller groups where peer interaction is more natural and comfortable Letter and Word Study Major research studies have shown that systematic explicit phonics instruction is the most effective type of instruction especially for those students who are considered at risk for academic failure Therefore Letter and Word Study in the primary grades K including online learning will focus primarily on phonics instruction in which soundsspellings are introduced systematically and sequentially taught in isolation blended into whole words and practiced in decodable texts Further spelling instruction and wordwork activities allow students to practice soundspelling patterns by building manipulating and sorting words to reinforce decoding and word attack skills Dictation activities connect the process of encoding to decoding as students learn that their sound spelling knowledge allows them to read as well as communicate through writing Primary grades also include high frequency word instruction to help students become fluent readers By the end of nd grade students will be expected to have mastered high frequency words taken from the Dolch Basic Sight Vocabulary and Frys Instant Words Students will chant spellout visualize hunt for and highlight these words in texts in addition to practicing them at home Classroom word walls will contribute to a printrich environment and word wall games and activities will reinforce learning In all grades letter and word study will include spelling instruction and targeted vocabulary development including academic vocabulary Spelling instruction will be based on a students developmental stage as determined by administration of Words Their Way Qualitative Spelling Inventory Spelling requires a higher level of precision than reading so when teachers consider the developmental reading and spelling stages of a child instructional strategies can be implemented which foster overall literacy development Spelling lists will be grouped by pattern sound visual or meaning and presented in a systematic sequence Teachers will then engage students in activities such as making words word sorting closed blind and speed and word hunts which allow them to actively analyze and categorize words thereby discovering spelling rules and generalizations Again this approach allows for multilevel instruction as students learn and participate in similar activities but at their own level Targeted vocabulary development at all levels will be aimed at making sure students acquire new word knowledge and increase their depth of knowledge over time Instruction in specific words and concepts will occur through explicit teaching and modeling when words are conceptually difficult For example teachers preteach vocabulary that is Rhodes L Shanklin N Windows into literacy Assessing learners K Portsmouth NH Heinemann Report of the National Reading Panel A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology important to student understanding of the content or due to its usefulness or general utility This will be critical when teaching academic vocabulary or words that are traditionally used in written text and dialogue between a teacher and student which may be less familiar to students Teachers use a variety of techniques to help students make connections between unfamiliar words with their own background knowledge Explicit instruction in wordlearning strategies allows students to determine meanings of unfamiliar words encountered while reading These strategies include teaching students to use dictionaries online sources and other resource aids to deepen understanding of words instruction in word structure as it relates to meaning morphemes affixes roots and directly teaching students to identify and use external clues to determine word meaning from context Starting in the primary grades teachers will model these learning strategies as they read aloud using picture and text clues to help students learn simple ways of applying context clues As students get older they will learn and apply more sophisticated strategies such as identifying examples restatements and comparisons in order to clarify word meanings Upper grade students will apply knowledge of word origins and Greek and Latin roots especially in contentarea texts Independent Reading Throughout the day students will have time to choose and enjoy reading books that are of interest to them an integral part of our curriculum at all levels Libraries will be stocked with highinterest books of various genres at a variety of levels Teachers will explicitly teach students how to select books appropriate to their level and interests Often teachers will create special book boxes or areas of the room stocked with books that relate to current themes in the classroom eg first graders learning about seasons will have access to a variety of fiction and nonfiction texts relating to weather and seasons including poetry and magazine articles To motivate students to read to give students more opportunities to apply new learning and to help instill a love of literature students will be given opportunities to talk about or respond to the books they read For example Kindergarteners may draw a picture of their favorite part of a favorite story and tell why they liked it while rd grade students complete reflection forms to evaluate books read In addition students at all grade levels will be expected to read nightly books either found at home or schoolprovided library books and keep a reading log that is signed by their parents bilingual logs will be available as needed This outside reading will be rewarded with various incentives such as reading parties where students celebrate their reading success and enjoyment Writing Lab The CTech writing program is aligned to the Common Core emphasis on writing The chief component of the writing program will be the acclaimed Writers Workshop based on the Lucy CalkinsTeachers College Writers Workshop model Writers Workshop which is based on the constructivist principle that learning to write is as much about the process as the product is used to teach students in all grade levels how to enjoy writing and at the same time reach the goal of becoming competent writers The Writers Workshop design one of the core stations consists of three components that occur daily the Minilesson or direct instruction independent writing time and share time Mini lessons can relate to craft applications content or strategies skills conventions and editing or A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology procedures relating to workshop These short focused lessons are based on standards or elements of a particular genre and on the observed needs of the students Minilessons follow the same basic structure schoolwide teachers provide a connection to previous learning explicitly teach a strategy using modeling techniques published literature and teacher and student writing provide active engagement often in the form of partner talk and provide a link which sets the intention for students to apply the new strategy in their own work During independent writing time students choose writing topics a strategy that helps develop personal investment in the writing process They apply learning from minilessons move themselves through the writing process and may engage in partner talk to help focus and develop ideas Students understand the rituals and procedures of the workshop including how to access materials and information from around the room charts posters model authors and to organize their writers notebooks and folders The teacher uses this time to take quick inventories of the class confer formally and informally with students and track student progress on conference logs The sharing component of workshop occurs at the end of workshop and provides another opportunity for teaching and reinforcing the content of the minilesson Sharing takes a variety of forms including Authors Chair pairshare or popcorn around the room During this time the teacher can also to address listening and speaking standards Teachers model the process that teaches students to use the language of the genre and the standards to refer to the authors text to support comments and to provide specific feedback to help peers move forward The writing conference is an integral part of workshop These frequent ongoing conferences allow teachers the opportunity to further provide personal targeted instruction that equips all students with the necessary tools to develop their authorship The teachers role is to understand where an individual writer is at a particular moment in time to determine the goalsneeds of that student along with an appropriate course of action and then to guide the student toward those goals The teacher reinforces the childs strengths and motivates the child to push himselfherself by applying new learning Teachers keep detailed conference notes in order to evaluate students progress and determine next steps for instruction Additional support for students demonstrating difficulties might include scaffolding in the form of graphic organizers or sentence frames more frequent meetings with the teacher or paraprofessionalinstructional aide and peer support in the form of a specific writing partner Teachers might also allow students struggling to articulate their thoughts on paper to dictate their ideas to them in order to facilitate the writing process until students become more confident in their abilities There are four basic writing modes that students will master as they progress through CTech descriptive expository narrative and creative We have added a fifth mode for creative writing as we feel this is an extremely important aspect of writing for students to develop both as it aligns to the projectbased learning model and as creative writing fosters a love for literacy These basic modes can then be broken down into subcategories described below Basic Modes Descriptive Writing The primary purpose of descriptive writing is to describe a person place or event so that the topic can be clearly seen in the readers mind The writer must use vivid details that paint a picture for the reader Expository Writing The primary purpose of expository writing is to provide information such as an explanation or directions A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Narrative Writing The primary purpose of narrative writing is to describe an experience event or sequence of events in the form of a story Persuasive Writing The primary purpose of persuasive writing is to give an opinion and try to influence the readers way of thinking with supporting evidence Creative Writing The primary purpose of creative writing is to entertain the reader Subcategories o Argumentative Writing This form of persuasive writing has a primary purpose of making a statement that the reader will disagree with then supporting the statement with specific details that will convince the reader of the truth of the statement o Business Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of communicating with others in the work place o Comparison and Contrast Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of showing the similarities and differences between two subjects o Expressive Writing This form of creative writing has a primary purpose of sharing thoughts ideas and feelings on the topic o Informative Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of providing information in a clear concise manner o Literary Response This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of providing a personal reaction to a piece of literature o Personal Narrative Writing This form of narrative writing has a primary purpose of sharing an experience or event from the authors own life o Poetry This form of creative writing has a primary purpose of imaginatively reflecting on a subject idea or event This is usually done in stanzas rather than paragraphs o Process Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of explaining the steps or procedure of something o Reaction Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of providing a personal response to something o Research Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of reporting new information that has been learned by studying available resources o Technical Writing This form of expository writing has a primary purpose of conveying technical information in a simple nononsense manner Speaking Speaking is very important to vocabulary and language development and contributes to social development In all classrooms teachers will provide students with multiple opportunities to explore oral communication in the classroom For example students will develop active and responsive listening skills through class and small group discussions Classes will take turns presenting and performing at weekly Friday School Meetings Each teacher will use scaffolding strategies to help English Learners build confidence in communicating information and ideas One way this is done is by giving students scripts using sentence frames that provide students with appropriate language structures Additional structured speaking activities in class will include Authors Chair and literature circles where students discuss and analyze elements of books as well as relate reading experiences to their own lives Students will practice speaking clearly and using complete sentences during formal oral reports and presentations Teachers will develop specific rubrics based on ELA and ELD standards that they share with students in order to communicate A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology expectations These rubrics will provide students with an understanding of the components of effective speaking enabling them to reflect on their own performance and from the presentations of their peers Listening Based on the ELA and ELD standards for listening students will be taught that active effective listening is a habit to develop and the foundation of effective communication Students will be taught how to focus their attention avoid distractions use body position to signal their interest express appreciation and appropriately pose questions Some of the ways in which active listening skills are practiced include following oral directions answering questions after readaloud critiquing shared pieces in Writers Workshop writing dictated sentences and repeating rhythms through movement and clapping For example in second grade to address the standard that requires students to give and follow multistep directions teachers will create projects that require partners to listen to each others directions in order to correctly complete a task Partner A learns how to complete part of the task and gives directions to Partner B then they switch roles Success depends on careful listening on the part of both students English Language DevelopmentEnglish Language Arts

notation graphs of linear and quadratic functions radical equations ratio and proportion and the quadratic formula Many problems are presented in context and students are required to read interpret and solve such problems C Science Core Subject All of CTech science classes are aligned to the Science Content Standards for California Public Schools and the Next Generation Science Standards The Science curriculum develops student exploration of recurring concepts and connections made within the subjects of Life Science Earth Science and Physical Science The curriculum uses the scientific process of inquiry and emphasizes the process of formulating and answering questions about the physical world around them and encourages students to explore appreciate the natural world they live in Students develop the skills of hypothesis forming identification classification experimentation evaluation documentation and presentation They create and lead meaningful scientific experiments that allow them to make real life connections and applications Students engage in scientific learning as they hone the skills of observation questioning hypotheses development experimentation data collection and analysis Students work individually or in small groups to complete labs investigate study scientific phenomena and share the results with their peers This type of learning reinforces the importance of longterm research collaboration and analysis of multiple outcomes The scientific themes of observation questioning making predictions based on evidence conducting investigations measurement comparison and classification are integrated with other subjects like math computers and ELA to strengthen their mastery of other content and learning Our inquirybased science curriculum will emphasize learning through exploration and experience relying on the acclaimed Full Option Science System FOSS kits for grades K which provide handson investigations laboratory experiences and projects The program is fully aligned to California standards and research has demonstrated its efficacy in engaging and educating diverse students However at CTech we believe that scientific knowledge is ever growing and so while FOSS will serve as a foundation to our science program we will also partner with the vibrant technology and science community only available in Pasadena as we work to build an experiential curriculum with community partners For example we are partnering with a local Pasadena company which manufactures robotic arms for use on the Mars Rover and other deep A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology space projects to share with our students knowledge about the solar system deep space and simple engineering principles The following chart indicates the sequence of the standardsbased FOSS units that will be used to facilitate student engagement and understanding of the standards for physical life and earth sciences in grades K Literature is also infused into the science curriculum to reinforce content literacy skills and boost comprehension on all grade levels Students engage and read about science through both fiction and nonfiction texts selected by teachers Contentrich and high interest trade books will be used to support the development of science concepts and associated academic language across all grade levels because children tend to have greater interest in the content and photographs that are available in trade books and they find them less confusing than traditional science textbooks Additionally the story lines in childrens trade books help students understand and remember concepts better than textbooks that tend to present science as lists of facts to be memorized The colorful pictures and graphics are also superior to many texts for explaining abstract ideas and provide contexts for understanding difficult science concepts An integral part of the units are activities conducted around the scientific method predicting and making hypotheses recording observations and using data to reach conclusions This foundation of scientific discovery is further reinforced in our entrepreneurship curriculum where for example a student might be challenged to make hypotheses about how product will sell build a prototype and evaluate the sales data Technology also is incorporated into science activities when appropriate For example Google Apps can facilitate data analysis construction of graphs and tables and interpretation of results This online learning tool will also help enhance the learning of specific subgroups For example along with online resources this online learning tool will be used to scaffold content for English Learners and create challenging assignments for advanced students For middle grades middle school science program will be informed by Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California Berkeley This curriculum known as the Science Education for Public Understanding Program SEPUP is fully aligned with California state standards and National Science Foundation education standards see httpsepuplhsorg and provides handson investigations student resources laboratory experiences and projects The school will utilize standards based materials for the few state standards not covered by SEPUP SEPUP also lends itself to traditional quantitative assessments that are appropriate for middle grade students Teachers will therefore be able to utilize a variety of pedagogical methods and a variety of assessments in order to best develop conceptual understanding via students own inquiries investigations and analyses The curriculum provides students with science experiences that are appropriate to their stages of cognitive development The experiences serve as a foundation for more advanced ideas that prepare students for life in an increasingly complex scientific and technological world SEPUP learning modules are organized under the following strands Issues and Life Science Butzow Carol and John Science through Childrens Literature An Integrated Approach A Community of st Century

modules and courses are designed to be appropriate for two grade levels and work in conjunction with one another to cover all of the state and national content standards in science For example the Issues and Earth Science strand aligns with the Middle School Earth Science Standard MSESS requiring the development and use of a model regarding lunar phases and eclipses In addition to the science standards SEPUP reinforces many mathematics language arts and social studies standards For example when studying life and earth sciences students will also study humans relationship with flora fauna and the natural environment throughout time and in different locations In this way life and earth sciences will be connected to economics and history When studying the physical sciences students will explore human inventions and discoveries in the realm of physics and engineering and the greater ramifications of industrialization warfare and technology Students will see connections between the physical sciences and their present reality history and economics Crossdisciplinary PBL units will offer handson opportunities for students to work independently and in groups to reinforce these concepts and discover the connections among subjects This program provides handson investigations laboratory experiences and projects It also lends itself to traditional quantitative assessments in the form of tests and quizzes Teachers will therefore be able to utilize a variety of pedagogical methods and a variety of assessments in order to best develop conceptual understanding in all students

program however CTech has planned to provide a strategic system of professional growth and improvement systems aligned to Californias Quality Professional Learning Standards Professional growth and improvement will be based on data that aligns professional learning priorities design and assessments to content and pedagogy for all students especially significant subgroups of Black or African American Latino Students with Disabilities socioeconomically disadvantaged English Learners and Foster Youth The system will use an evidencebased approach which focuses on specific topics throughout the year for sustained learning that enables teachers staff and administrators to acquire the new content practice the strategies and assess whether the professional development improved practice and student outcomes CTech teachers will meet in Professional Learning Communities every Early Release Wednesday to ensure a collaborative learning process for teachers to positively impact student learning throughout the Charter School The Board of Directors with input from all stakeholders will set the goals for the following year based on student achievement behavior and attendance data then through a collaborative process the teachers parents staff administrators and community will then determine how to dedicate resources for professional learning to accomplish the goals This will A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology be evidenced by the LCAP The Charter School will utilize the system of professional growth and learning in alignment with state and federal requirements and resources CTech has also determined that a system of support for teachers principals and school leaders from the beginning of their careers throughout their careers and through advancement opportunities is imperative to ensure ongoing professional growth and learning Each staff member will work with hisher supervisor at the beginning of each school year to establish SMART goals that include opportunities for professional growth and development For clerical and classified staff they will learn to share responsibilities to support each other attend County Office of Education jobspecific trainings visit colleagues at other Charter Schools attend conferences or workshops related to their jobs like paraprofessional human resources and business management trainings For new teachers this may include completing a new teacher induction program clearing hisher credential taking additional classes completing a masters degree working with a veteran teacher who will mentor them by lesson modeling peer observation and coplanning lessons Veteran teachers receive an opportunity to serve as a mentor teacher lead professional development sessions in an areas of expertise serve as a teacher leader as content specialist grade level leader serve on the School Site Council attend conferences like Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning Conference CUE Conference NewSchools Venture Fund Summit NGSS or other conferences of hisher choice decided by the SMART goals and approved by their supervisor then returning to the Charter School to present their professional learning to other teachers Advancement opportunities for teachers include those opportunities previously mentioned In addition teachers can advance by taking the CSET to become an administrator completing a Masters degree in Educational Administration or becoming a National Board Certified Teacher New administrators are provided the opportunity to clear their Administrative Services Credential attend Principal Institutes and work with a seasoned administrator Administrators can advance by attending trainings workshops and conferences by serving on a WASC Visitation Committee for other schools serve as readers for CDE grants and programs and write and present conference proposals for conferences like California Charter Schools Association CCSA and Charter Schools Development Center CSDC The Charter School will determine how this system promotes professional growth and ensures improvement by evaluating the success of each staff member at the end of the school year to determine if heshe met or exceeded their established SMART goals reviews multiple measures of student data and analyzes the data over time The administrators will ensure participation in professional growth and learning by verifying signin sheets observing strategies in the classroom analyzing data and determining that professional growth is occurring and improvements in teacher capacity and student achievement is realized Most importantly the Charter School will use input provided by staff teachers and administrators immediately following a professional learning session and then again three months later to determine if professional learning is implemented and sustained It is with this ongoing professional development model in place that CTech has developed the annual professional development plan that specifies the proposed list of topics times and dates that will ensure that the teachers receive specific training on the educational program and the

Teachers CTech will recruit teachers who are qualified to deliver the educational program including any innovative components of the program CTech will recruit teachers trained by the USC Rossier School of Education EdJoin and through the Charter Schools website CTech will seek teachers who are committed to the mission and vision of the Charter School The teachers will be expected to be sensitive to the linguistic and cultural needs of students and to participate in professional development to enhance their skills in this area Employees job descriptions and work schedules will be reviewed and modified as necessary to meet the needs of the Charter School and its students All requirements for employment set forth in applicable provisions of law will be met A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Current CTech job descriptions and qualification for key employee positions are outlined below in Element Meeting the Needs of All Students CTech is an inclusive Charter School and will offer services for all students in special populations This includes but is not limited to students who qualify for Free or ReducedPrice Lunch students who are designated as English Learners and students who receive Special Education services C Tech will serve all students with an Individualized Education Program IEP CTech will follow the applicable laws and regulations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act The students who are designated as EL will receive daily instruction in ELD during integrated ELD in core content areas and designated ELD daily In addition teachers will use Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English SDAIE strategies including accessing prior knowledge cooperative learning handson instruction student communication explicit vocabulary instruction multicultural education and checking for understanding Students are most successful when there is a cooperative effort between parents and Charter School personnel in a spirit of shared responsibility CTechs structures for regular planning and collaboration in PLCs provides teachers with time to evaluate data and to plan strategically to support all learners Instruction is differentiated according to learning styles strengths abilities and interests to support all learners Students receive actionable and timely feedback which empowers them to succeed by building on what they know All students will receive a rigorous standardsbased innovative educational experience Students who experience problems with achieving academically or who demonstrate the need for behavior support are referred to interventions andor the Student Support and Progress Team SSPT for further discussion on further interventions CTech maintains a culture of high expectations for all students and promotes success for all The Charter School believes that all students can attain high standards regardless of their strengths challenges and life experiences and therefore all students should be offered opportunities to engage in a rigorous curriculum Students who are not meeting grade level benchmarks are provided additional interventions during the instructional day during core instruction and during Universal Access The interventions focus on building and supporting basic reading writing and math skills for success in the regular grade level appropriate curriculum Students will be identified for interventions based on the following assessmentsperformances Students performing well below proficiency or not approaching mastery of standards especially in Language Arts and Mathematics Progress reports and report cards sent home by teachers Fall Universal Testing NWEA MAP Student score on the ELPAC Test A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Student score on Smarter Balanced Assessments Formative and summative assessments given by classroom teachers Student Request Parent Request CTech teachers will address the needs of students achieving below grade level including appropriate modifications in any of the following program components MultiTier System of Supports CTech is built on the MultiTier System of Supports MTSS which encompasses a Response to Intervention RtI program but goes beyond the student interventions MTSS addresses academic as well as the social emotional and behavioral development of children from early childhood to promotion It provides multiple levels of support for all learners below grade level to above grade level CTech will align resources and support for students receiving instruction and for teachers and other support staff who are delivering the instruction This model is an educational paradigm shift that ensures that overall school improvement will be sustainable C Tech will provide continued support for teachers in delivering instruction utilizing and developing effective curriculum administering assessment and using data to guide instruction This process requires greater collaboration between general education teachers special education teachers and paraprofessionals which CTech has built into the daily schedule The greatest difference is that MTSS at CTech includes a focus on intervention but has a stronger goal of prevention The key is the professional development that is included for all staff which creates a more collaborative and cohesive culture for the betterment of students Hurst SSPT Process The Student Support and Progress Team is a positive schoolwide early intervention process to support students who are not making satisfactory academic progress or to support students when their behaviors are impeding their own progress or the progress of others CTech will set up an SSPT which will be comprised of parentsguardians teachers administrators and other professionals and the student as appropriate The SSPT will meet regularly to highlight a students A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology strengths upon which a plan for improvement can be based Concerns are viewed as obstacles to student performance and not indicative of the student or hisher character The SSPT designs a practical support plan that all team members agree to implement Followup meetings may take place to monitor student progress with the interventions in place The SSPT may determine to refer a student for special education evaluation after one meeting or may monitor the student through the SSPT Protocol based on student need SSPT Protocol Step The Charter School personnel teacher support staff administrator or the parent requests a referral to the Student Support and Progress Team This referral includes information regarding specific concerns and previously attempted interventions and accommodations Parent is contacted and informed of referral information could Step The team members review and collect information relevant to the students performance file This parentteacheradministrator observations grade reports tests homework attendance parent information regarding the students academic and health history teacher reports results of statedistrict academic assessments and a list of modifications or interventions previously attempted and documented in the IDLP in students cumulative information provided include Step The team establishes a meeting time when all members can participate and be actively involved in the problemsolving process A translator is arranged if needed Step The SSPT meeting representatives summarize strengths and concerns and discuss and develop an action plan with academic or behavioral interventions Modified interventions are then documented and monitored for success The team brings completed evaluation forms appropriate work samples list of interventions attempted and the students cumulative file Step If plan is unsuccessful a follow up meeting will be held within weeks to discuss alternatives for accommodations The SSPT process may be repeated or the SSPT may determine to refer a student for special education evaluation based on the severity of student need If the revised plan remains unsuccessful the student may qualify for more structured modifications or a plan An unsuccessful SSPT process could lead to a determination of qualification for Special Education All throughout the SSPT process clear lines of communication will be in place between CTech administration staff and special education staff as appropriate as the SSPT process is implemented English Learners Overview The Charter School will meet all applicable legal requirements for ELs including longterm ELs or ELs at risk of becoming longterm ELs as they pertain to annual notification to parents student identification placement program options EL and core content instruction teacher qualifications and training reclassification to fluent English proficient status monitoring and evaluating program A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology effectiveness and standardized testing requirements The Charter School will implement policies to ensure proper placement evaluation and communication regarding EL and the rights of students and parents The Charter School will follow the LAUSD English Learner Master Plan Home Language Survey Charter School will administer the home language survey upon a students initial enrollment into the Charter School on enrollment forms English Language Proficiency Assessment All parents who indicate that their home language upon their childs initial enrollment is other than English will be tested with the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California The ELPAC has four proficiency levels Level well developed Level moderately developed Level somewhat developed and Level minimally developed and is aligned with the California ELD Standards The ELPAC consists of two separate assessments Initial Assessment IA The ELPAC IA is used to identify students as either an English Learner or as fluent in English The IA is administered only once during a students time in the California public school system based upon the results of the home language survey The locally scored IA will be the official score The IA is given to students in grades whose primary language is not English to determine their English proficiency status Summative Assessment SA ELs will take the SA every year until they are reclassified as fluent English proficient The ELPAC SA is only given to students who have previously been identified as an EL based upon the IA results in order to measure how well they are progressing with English development in each of the four domains The results are used as one of four criteria to determine if the student is ready to be reclassified as fluent English proficient to help inform proper educational placement and to report progress for accountability Both the ELPAC SA and IA are paperpencil assessments administered in seven grade spansK and In kindergarten and grade all domains are administered individually In grades the test is administered in groups exclusive of speaking which is administered individually Testing times will vary depending upon the grade level domain and individual student Both the ELPAC IA and SA are given in two separate testing windows through the school year The IA testing window will be yearround July June Any student whose primary language is other than English as determined by the home language survey and who has not previously been identified as an English Learner by a California public school or for whom there is no record of results from an administration of an English language proficiency test shall be assessed for English language proficiency within calendar days after the date of first enrollment in a California A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology public school or within calendar days before the date of first enrollment but not before July of that school year The SA testing window will be a fourmonth window after January February May The English language proficiency of all currently enrolled English Learners shall be assessed by administering the test during the annual assessment window The Charter School will notify all parents of its responsibility for ELPAC testing and of ELPAC results within thirty days of receiving results from publisher The ELPAC shall be used to fulfill the requirements under Every Student Succeeds Act for annual English proficiency testing Reclassification Procedures Reclassification procedures utilize multiple criteria in determining whether to classify a pupil as proficient in English including but not limited to all of the following Assessment of language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument including but not limited to the ELPAC Participation of the students classroom teachers and any other certificated staff with direct responsibility for teaching or placement decisions of the pupil to evaluate the students curriculum mastery Parental opinion and consultation achieved through notice to parents or guardians of the language reclassification and placement including a description of the reclassification process and the parents opportunity to participate and encouragement of the participation of parents or guardians in the reclassification procedure including seeking their opinion and consultation during the reclassification process Comparison of the students performance in basic skills against an empirically established range of performance in basic skills based upon the performance of English proficient students of the same age that demonstrate to others that the pupil is sufficiently proficient in English to participate effectively in a curriculum designed for pupils of the same age whose native language is English This could include SBAC scores NWEA MAP assessment data grade in Language Arts and other empirical data The Charter School will monitor RFEP students for four years and will follow the Reclassification Criteria Overall English Proficiency Level of or higher on ELPAC with oral and written language a Level or higher Met or Exceeded on SBAC in ELA teacher evaluation and parent notification LongTerm English Learners LTELs The goal for reclassification is for each EL to make one years of growth toward English proficiency for each year heshe is enrolled in school CTech has determined that a specific group of students who need special attention are ELs who have been identified as LTELs who are currently enrolled in middle school previously attended school for six years or longer and who have not met the requirements for reclassification LTELs are a challenge in California In California started requiring the number of LTELs to be reported in CALPADS In Californians Together an advocacy organization determined that of Californias ELs had in fact been in school for six or more years and still A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology had not attained the skills they needed to be reclassified as Fluent English Proficient This highlights the fact that students in higher level classes like English Algebra Geometry Biology and Chemistry require strong academic vocabulary which many LTELs have not mastered Strategies for English Learner Instruction and Intervention Every teacher at CTech will have either a Cross Cultural Language and Academic Development CLAD or Bilingual CrossCultural Language and Academic Development BCLAD certificate and will have the ability to provide instruction to the EL Every EL will receive integrated ELD utilizing SDAIE strategies in content areas taught in English in addition to daily ELD for minutes per day taught by a credentialed teacher utilizing specialized ELD curriculum during ELD through the use of the ELAELD Framework Some of the teachers will also be trained in Guided Language Acquisition Design GLAD Total Physical Response TPR will integrate the coordination of language and physical movements to develop language pathways between words in one language and actions in another Multiple mediums such as audio electronic visual and art will be relied upon to present information to EL since research shows that children acquire language faster when presented through various models Clancy M Hruska B Additional instructional strategies that may be used to help support ELs include Frontloading vocabulary Models demonstrations visuals and realia Manipulative materials and handson materials Repetition and review of concept and vocabulary Choice of resources tasks language production options Active participation in various individual and group configurations Printrich environment Authentic and meaningful tasks making connections between learning and reallife experience Integration of listening speaking reading and writing with content areas Opportunities for reflection and verbalizing thoughts through academic talk Standardsbased unit organization Assessment and monitoring of progress toward standards and check for understanding Development of metacognition and goal setting Total Physical Response and Explicit instruction in key skills eg preview scanning skimming Monitoring and Evaluation of EL Program Effectiveness The Charter School evaluates the effectiveness of its education program for EL by Adhering to Charter Schooladopted academic benchmarks by language proficiency level and years in program to determine annual progress Monitoring teacher qualifications and the use of appropriate instructional strategies based on program design Monitoring student identification and placement Monitoring parental program choice options Monitoring availability of adequate resources Monitoring English Learner Progress A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology The teachers will utilize the EL folders described below and collect work samples to measure progress regarding comprehension fluency vocabulary pronunciation and grammar usage four times a year Teachers will provide quarterly progress reports to parents on the growth of their English Proficiency Staff will monitor Reclassified Fluent English Proficient students for four years The English Language Coordinator will maintain a list of students who are identified as EL with ELPAC SBAC date of entry to US and Reclassification data CTech will also maintain grade progression benchmark scores and promotion to next grade with standard mastery Each EL has an ELD Folder to track academic progress CTech will maintain ELD information including Home Language Survey ELPAC results Reclassification Forms and Reclassification Years monitoring forms CTech will provide intervention to students who score Standard Not Met or Standard Nearly Met in English Language Arts and Math on the SBAC during Universal Access Gifted and Talented GATE and Students Achieving Above Grade Level Talent Development Initially proposed by the former Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed AtRisk the Talent defined as a high level of performance Development Model is a comprehensive paradigm for school reform that argues the traditional function of schooling to classify sort and weed out should shifted to maximizing every students full potential They note that schools must move toward the principle of what they call the overdetermination of success or the notion that across the full spectrum of the schooling enterprise we implement multiple activities any one of which based on documented researchbased evidence can lead to enhanced outcomes by itself By simultaneously implementing such multiple programs practices and procedures we increase the possibility of success ie making the possibility of success redundant by substantially reducing the chances that students will fall through the cracks of failure Boykin Boykin further argues that students should develop their communication skills their composition skills creative writing as well as a high level of numeracy that they should be intellectual entrepreneurs and leaders in their own preparation for the st Century workforce Therefore CTech will not identify GATE students CTech will determine and meet the educational needs of gifted and talented students and students achieving above grade level by maximizing every students full potential The students will be homogeneously grouped during English Language Arts Mathematics and Universal Access at a minimum During Universal Access the students achieving above grade level will be provided designated instruction by a fully credentialed teacher for specific instruction focusing on oral communication composition and creative writing and well as automaticity and numeracy in mathematics This instruction may focus on speech and debate expository persuasive narrative and descriptive writing creative writing to include short stories poetry lyrics fantasy fiction graphic novels screenwriting and automaticity and numeracy in mathematics to include math fact fluency by having efficient and accurate methods for computing and utilizing flexibility in choosing which method to use to demonstrate conceptual understanding A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Students Achieving Below Grade Level CTech will implement a data based multitiered system of support using a number of data points to monitor student success Budgetary decisions in the LCAP will focus on supporting the needs of the students achieving below grade level as well as unduplicated pupils CTech will utilize data systems such as Illuminate PowerSchool and Infinite Campus Regardless of chosen technology these systems will be able to track student achievement history teacher comments supports and interventions and onsite anecdotal data collection to identify students achieving below grade level All CTech students will participate in and benefit from an academically rigorous and standards based curriculum Students achieving below grade level will be identified by meeting any of the following criteria performs at least two grades below grade level does not meet standards on state testing answers sixtypercent or more incorrectly on school benchmarks or multiple measures assessments receives a score of one which is the lowest score a student may receive Teachers will identify students achieving below grade and will notify parentsguardians of their childs academic levels before the end of the first quarter The teacher will develop an Individual Learning and Development Plan ILDP to address the specific needs of each student but especially students achieving below grade level which includes specific interventions that will help the student The teacher is also responsible to refer the student to the SSPT process if necessary Interventions CTech will take a systematic approach to closing the achievement gap by allocating multiple resources to students achieving below grade level All students will have the benefit of a longer school day access to an individual tablet or Chromebook individualized instruction small class sizes and focus on creativity and technology One key intervention for students achieving below grade level is targeted intervention provided during core content instruction but especially during Universal Access Students achieving below grade level will be placed in a Universal Access group based on hisher greatest need whether it is English Language Arts or Mathematics or both The students will receive tailored instruction for minutes a day during Universal Access Progress Monitoring CTech is also committed to monitoring the progress of students achieving below grade level as part of prevention and interventions As part of the MTSS CTech will utilize RtI and monitor the progress of each student achieving below grade level through the following processes Tier Foundational Program a all teachers instruct to the standards on a daily basis b all student work aligns to standards and c all students are able to describe what they are learning and why reflecting on their learning Small group instruction IDLP and differentiation are used at this level As part of the Tier foundation all students participate in Universal Access Data mined from the beginning of the year including the benchmarks NWEA MAP assessments previous year ELPAC and SBAC assessments will be used to determine students strengths and challenges During A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Universal Access students will receive individualized instruction and activities to strengthen their progress toward standards mastery The differentiated instruction and work will allow for all students to access both the curriculum and subject content at various academic levels A students specific need may change as interventions are put into place which is why CTech will utilize progress monitoring to adjust the interventions to assure standard mastery Students will also take part in small group instruction during this time and work both individually and collaboratively depending on the assignment or the activity For a majority of students this individualized protected time should offer the assistance needed to be academically successful For the remainder of students who this does not help in making significant gains they will take part in Tier of RtI Tier Strategic Intervention Identified students will receive strategic intervention for minutes within the instructional day in the areas of English andor Mathematics in a smallgroup or fewer students setting Through a small group setting standard and concept specific lessons will be administered Teachers will be able to observe and assess students both formally and informally and differentiate as needed Strategic intervention allows students to practice and develop skills Ongoing benchmark and progress monitoring will be used to adjust interventions Tier groupings are flexible and can be changed as necessary The groupings fluidity allows for students to make progress to assess out of this tier while other students can participate if warranted Tier Intensive Intervention Identified students will receive intensive intervention for at least minutes within the instructional day in the areas of English andor Mathematics in a very small group or students or on setting Intensive intervention will allow students to receive explicit instruction and focus on only one skill until proficient and prepared to move on Highly flexible grouping will allow teachers to reorganize students including multiage grouping when appropriate Student progress will be monitored on an ongoing basis through a combination of teacher observation checklists classroom assessments intervention assessments and benchmark assessments to determine the effectiveness of interventions Student progress will be communicated to the parent or guardian every six weeks If after the intervention session the strategies in place are deemed unsuccessful the student may repeat an intervention or move up a Tier If the student is not making adequate progress at Tier he or she will be referred to the SSPT process if they have not been previously referred In addition to implementing an RtI program to help students achieving below grade level teachers will complete an IDLP This ILDP will be content specific goal specific and provide strategies and timelines to assist in helping the student make academic progress Strategies will include individualized instruction peertopeer tutoring close reading and increasing a students self confidence Parents will be part of the process in developing the ILDP by meeting or communicating with the teachers regarding the actions needed Weekly homework logs reading logs and activity logs will be a part of the ILDP and will need the parents involvement at home The ILDP will be reviewed every six to eight weeks by the teachers and decisions regarding effectiveness will be determined by the students improvements in targeted areas During daily Universal Access time in addition to small group instruction teachers will address the specific areas identified in each students ILDP by providing targeted instruction individually A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology in small groups through guided practice and by providing feedback Additionally teachers will work with students achieving below grade level by setting weekly and monthly goals in specific content areas Teachers will also send home weekly reports recognizing student strengths and targeted goal for the following week Socioeconomically DisadvantagedLow Income Students CTech anticipates serving about of the students who are socioeconomically disadvantagedlow income CTech will identify SED students through the completion of the Lunch Application Any student who qualifies for free or reduced lunch will be recorded in the Student Information System and consequently in CALPADS CTech has incorporated many support structures into the Charter School to support SED students Some of the services will include serving breakfast and lunch providing small classes IDLPs onetoone computers Caring School Community and a longer school day The supports for SED families include a family resource center parent workshops partnerships with no or low cost medical dental and vision clinics and opportunities for involvement The school dress code will establish a friendly and professional dress code atmosphere that promotes pride respect and safety for the students and staff As a family of professionals the basic standard for students is professional dress and pride in their appearance School is a place of business and education is the students job There will also funds allocated for students who cannot afford a school uniform The enrichment opportunities for SED students include Advisory courses Innovation Labs Cross Age Buddies field trips extracurricular activities during the school day to include dance music art technology coding robotics and entrepreneurship afterschool program and summer enrichment program The Executive Director will monitor the progress of SED students by observing and ensuring the implementation of services supports and enrichment The Executive Director will analyze data from annual surveys individual student growth and parent satisfaction Students in Other Subgroups CTech anticipates that about of students will be foster youth The Executive Director will serve as the homeless and foster youth liaison With the support of staff the Executive Director will provide outreach to families and coordinate services between the family and other agencies CTech is committed to provide a highquality education with all supports necessary to ensure that homeless and foster youth have the opportunity to succeed In order to assist homeless and foster youth the Executive Director will assist in procuring referrals to health dental mental health substance abuse services housing services and any other appropriate services The Homeless Liaison will assist the parents or foster parents to enroll the student obtain necessary immunizations or immunization records If transportation is an issue the Executive Director will inform the parents of all transportation services available The Executive Director will encourage parents to be involved in their childs education and ensure that parents are informed of educational and related opportunities to assist their child to be academically successful CTech anticipate serving about of the students who are Standard English Learners SEL or students for whom Standard English may differ in structure andor form from the language spoken in the home SEL are typically identified as Black or African American Latino American Indian and Hawaiian American CTech will use NWEA MAP to assess academic progress and will screen students using LAUSDs SEL Linguistic Feature Diagnostic Screener to determine placement in Mainstream English Language Development MELD SEL will benefit from A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology strong vocabulary development language and literacy structure and grammar and syntax orally and in writing The Executive Director and the teachers will monitor the progress of homeless and foster youth and SEL by NWEA MAP assessments SBAC scores ELPAC scores and other formative and summative assessments A Typical Day As a visitor enters CTech the visitor signs in at the main office to share that he is to observe for the day and receives a visitor badge As Mr Jones walks to the playground at AM he sees parents and guardians dropping off the students Most of the students on their way for breakfast The students eat breakfast then play in the playground as parents and administrators chat and yard supervisors monitor the students At AM the teachers enter the playground and talk with parents students and other staff At AM the teachers welcome the students in their class and walk them to class to get ready for the day Mr Jones follows a grade class and joins the students on the carpet as the teacher begins the Caring Classroom Morning Meeting at AM Valeria turns to Mr Jones says hello and asks his name He responds Mr Jones Valeria says Hello Mr Jones I am Valeria and I am the classroom greeter Mr Jones notes that all the students say Hello and Good Morning to each other He recognizes that they are looking in each others eyes The teacher Mrs Adams tells the students to ask about their weekend and to listen to one important part of their weekend and remember it The students continue to talk to each other and offer empathetic comments and ask questions to help them remember what their classmate says Mrs Adams asks the students for the pairs to share their partners weekend with another pair Then Mrs Adams leads a direct lesson on asking for help when needed and how to determine what questions could be selfanswered peer answered or adult answered Mrs Adams then leads the students through a mindfulness activity Valeria is excited to imagine herself going through the day and is very excited that they are reading a new story in Language Arts and that during Innovation Lab they will be using the D printer to make the robot shell for their group project Mrs Adams has the students reflect on how to successful today then the students share with their partners It is going to be a great day Mr Jones observes Valeria and the other students go to their desks to pull out their Language Arts book as Mrs Adams leads them through a picture walk of the story and helps the students to predict what the story may be about using evidence from the pictures Mrs Adams then points to each new vocabulary word says it has the student repeat it and says it again She shows the student realia to show what the word means Each student then uses their bookmark to follow along as Mrs Adams begins reading the story She stops frequently to have the students reflect on the story and compare it to their predictions She refers to the print rich classroom to include the word wall and the group developed KWL Chart from last week She The students begin filling out the key details on a KWL Chart Mrs Adams continues this process until the story is complete The students then do a pair share to see if they were key details they missed Mrs Adams then reviews the KWL Chart and the key details with the students The students then focus on their predictions and write one sentence on the summary of the story Mrs Adams then leads the students in a choral reading before pairing off the students to read every other sentence to each other As the students are reading Mrs Adams circulates empowers her new readers and validating their efforts A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Mrs Adams then lets the students know that it is time for centers The students separate into their groups one at a table with the teacher one at a table with the paraprofessional one at the computers one on the carpet and one at their desks Mrs Adams made the groups based on the students Individual Learning Plans At the end of the session the students will have experienced a full rotation that included direct instruction in reading direct instruction in writing completing a supplemental language arts lesson on the computer assigned by the teacher for each student based on the most recent data independent reading and drawing a key detail and writing one sentence describing the key detail independently Mr Jones notices that two of the groups focus on ELD forms and functions with the teacher and paraprofessional At AM Mathematics starts on the carpet Mrs Adams leads a direct lesson from the curriculum using the number line the students have been working on adding and feel confident counting up Mrs Adams discusses how number lines help solve problems and the students think of examples of how they can count up by using the number of pets ages of their siblings number of boys and girls in the class etc Mr Jones is impressed how many examples the students come up with and how they can articulate their thinking Mrs Adams uses concrete pictorial and abstract approaches Mrs Adams then describes the independent assignment using manipulatives while one group works on a supplemental math lesson on the computer assigned by the teacher for each student based on the most recent data As the students begin she then calls up a small group to provide them with additional differentiated instruction Finally she works one on one with a student until he understands the process using the manipulatives and the number line Mrs Adams rotates the room clarifying information and thinking At the end of the lesson she reviews the process and calls up nonvolunteers to demonstrate the process Mrs Adams then breaks the students into groups and they work on a handson project using the number line manipulatives and pulling counting up sticks out of a can Mr Jones is again impressed on how the students demonstrate their reasoning At PM the students are dismissed to go to PE Valeria and Tamras class go to dance They knew the steps and were so excited to show off to their visitor Mr Jones The music was loud the steps were easy and the class is so fun Miss Williams finally teaches the class the finale Valeria gets the steps wrong but Miss Williams says not to worry they will keep working on it all week At PM Mrs Adams walks the class to the lunch line and she and Mr Jones have lunch Valeria and Tamra eat lunch and again jump rope At PM the students go to their designated ELDMELD class taught by the appropriately credentialed teachers determined by level Valeria is a Level Low Expanding and goes to Mr Ramirez class Tamra is an SEL and goes to Mr Alvarez class for MELD Valeria follows the curriculum and Mr Ramirez focuses the lesson on academic vocabulary which seems hard to Valeria until Mr Ramirez teaches the new vocabulary using Total Physical Response Pictures and concepts in context Mr Jones notices how comfortable the class is on using the new vocabulary in framed sentences A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Tamras class is also focusing on academic vocabulary using sentence frames reading the sentence frames and writing a new vocabulary word in a framed sentence At PM Mrs Adams meets them in the playground and walks them to class for Science today They have been working on their engineering design in preparation for Innovation Lab Since they are working on the D Printer during Innovation Lab Mrs Adams reviews the plan and carrying out the investigation The students participate in a thinkpairshare to communicate the plan and the process Each student has to identify the five components of the D printer Mr Jones tries to memorize them too Mrs Adams works with the students as a whole group to determine the math for the first setting on the D printer The students are excited about the robot and watch a short video on how the D printer works The students participate in a thinkpairshare to summarize how the D printer works in four steps At PM Mrs Adams walks the class to the Innovation Lab She reminds the students the expectations and procedures for behavior in the Innovation Lab Mrs Adams asks the students why they created and designed this robot The students share that they made this robot to help first responders find survivors in buildings after an earthquake This is their semester Global Grand Challenge The students brainstorm how they finished product will have strong tracks to propel the robot a camera to record the finding a light to illuminate the area and an SD card to store the images or pictures of survivors found Mrs Adams demonstrates the new vocabulary words with a toy car classroom lights and a camera with an SD card Mrs Adams separates the students into five groups each group responsible for setup and the four steps They are so excited Mr Jones is excited too since he has never seen a D printer Each group takes their turn and the class watches the process At the end each student gets a turn to touch hold and examine the robot shell Mr Jones giggles about how far innovative education has come At PM Mrs Adams brings the students to the carpet for their closing meeting Mrs Adams leads them in a short mindfulness exercise reviewing the highlights of the day as the students visualize their memory of the events while breathing deeply Mrs Adams asks each student to share one word about the day reminding them that each word can only be used once it could be a new word they learned or a word that highlights the day with a feeling emotion or accomplishment After all the students share Mrs Adams asks Mr Jones to share His word is impressive Mrs Adams dismisses the students and they run to their parents or the afterschool program It really was a great day A Community of st Century

Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology make key decisions about program development and modifications while also monitoring individual student achievement Method for Measuring Pupil Progress Toward Outcomes Formative Assessment In order to concretely measure progress toward mastery of the State Standards teachers will create specific objectives for each of their units and lessons The intent of the objectives is to break down the standards into concrete measurable units To measure individual students content and skill strength and areas of opportunity teachers will administer classroom based formative and summative assessments throughout the course progression Aligned to the standardsaligned course objectives these assessments drive instructional practice by identifying the areas for enrichment or remediation for each individual student In addition to teachercreated assessments and state assessments teachers and administrators will use informal assessments to gauge student academic achievement and progress toward mastery of the content standards Informal Assessments could be any of the following Conversations with students and families Anecdotal notes and observations Discussions at weekly professional development Questioning and Feedback of students Throughout the year the students will take multiple assessments as prescribed in the Assessment

strong goals for student achievement and the supports needed for Charter School teachers to analyze student data easily and continuously The most common type of data will be internally created assessments and curriculumbased assessments which teachers will create during summer and weekly professional development sessions These data will allow teachers to receive summative data quickly so they can immediately adjust instruction to assure student mastery of standards The use of NWEA MAP will allow teachers to receive formative data quickly so they can determine the strength of the lesson pacing and student mastery of standards After each NWEA MAP round of assessments results will be compiled and analyzed by Chief Academic Officer and teachers looking for areas of growth and new or continuing areas of opportunity Data will be disaggregated by subgroup to determine achievement gaps if any The Chief Academic Officer will perform an intensive analysis Staffwide Professional Development will take place after collection of results to address the trends identified in results analysis and adjusting instruction as necessary to meet the new and continuing needs of CTech students Results will then be shared with students and parents and summary data will be provided to the Board to discuss growth review and adjust goals discussed previously reporting of student achievement data includes the annual School Accountability Report Card SARC and reflection and analysis as part of the annual LCAP goal setting process Students NWEA MAP results will also trigger another review of a students current Charter School performance for either an intervention andor enrichment CTech will use a Student Information System to analyze student outcomes CTech will dedicate Wednesday afternoons to data analysis Students will be released early on Wednesdays and teachers will meet to analyze student work examine the weeks data from the Student Information System and deliver feedback to students parents and each other This will then allow them to design a schedule for the following week that targets the needs of the students Teachers will use the data in the Student Information System to monitor subgroups of students including homeless and foster youth English Learners Gifted and Talented academically low achieving students and students with disabilities Teachers will determine academic strategies for these subgroups of students and if a student needs a referral to different nonacademic supports A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Records of students social and character development will also be kept to highlight whole child development In addition to this frequent reporting of data and feedback students and teachers will get more summative reporting of progress at the completion of each course Students themselves will report out on their own growth during their semester presentations Use of Data CTech understands the power of data collection analysis reporting and use of data The process will begin with the development of the LCAP which includes input from parents students teachers staff and community and it is approved by the Board of Directors no later than June th for the following school year In the LCAP are the charter school goals and actions to address the State Priorities as identified by the stakeholders and a review of data The teachers will review formative and summative data individually and as noted in the professional development calendar collaboratively to develop the strategies that showed the most positive impact on student achievement At the beginning of each school year teacher and administration will meet to discuss topics data and goals for the school year to include curriculum assessments interventions enrichment grading SBAC and ELPAC data LCAP and more goal setting with ILDPs At the end of the school year the teachers will review the progress of all students via ILDPs including significant subgroups grade levels core content areas and the school as a whole and will set goals for the following school year The LCAP will be published on the Charter Schools website The Executive Director will review other school data and administer surveys to gauge student and family satisfaction with the program Data may include attendance discipline and Wellness Program indicators including Parent Satisfaction Surveys reviews of student files and progress monitoring Information from these reviews will support ongoing program and instructional improvement as well as provide families the opportunity to make suggestions about improving the Charter Schools policies practices and program Each year survey data from parents students and teachers will inform the Executive Director and Board of Directors of the specific needs of our stakeholders Data gathered through informal survey administration will be reviewed by the Executive Director and presented to the Board and teachers to ensure accountability for the Charter Schools continual growth The Executive Director will present results of assessments quarterly to the Board of Directors at regularly scheduled Board meetings so that the Board understands the students progress toward meeting goals The Executive Director will present the data to the Board aggregated school wide by grade level by significant subgroups eg ethnicity gender ELs SWD SED and by core content areas The Board meetings are open to all stakeholders The Executive Director will also develop the SARC for approval of the Board in January In addition CTech will hold parent workshops presented by the Executive Director Chief Academic Officer Dean of students Teachers Paraprofessionals community members or other Parents The topics subject to change for the school year include How to Understand my Students Assessments ELPAC and Benchmarks How to Support my Student with Homework Preparing for Assessments and Projects Why is Attendance Important What Role do Parents Play in School A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology LCAP Goals and Workshop How Can I Help Improve my Students Achievement Over the Summer CTech will use a student information system which will include a comprehensive platform designed to support a range of assessments to store assessment results and to communicate to parents about their students progress Reports can also be generated from the student information system to provide information to stakeholders CDE California School Dashboard CBEDS CALPADS and to respond to authorizer requests DATADRIVEN INSTRUCTION At CTech on an ongoing basis our instructional staff will gather and analyze student achievement data to drive instruction We will use the backwards design methodology to establish and assess student progress toward learning goals Faculty will administer daily weekly quarterly and annual assessments and conduct analysis of student achievement data to develop and refine instructional strategies and provide targeted support to ensure that each and every student is meeting the defined criteria for academic success Backwards Design CTech teachers will collaboratively plan units of study using the backward design guidelines described in Understanding by Design and begin with the question What would we accept as evidence that students have attained the desired understandings and proficiencies before proceeding to plan teaching and learning experiences Beginning with the California State Standards teachers will determine a threetiered hierarchical set of learning expectations Enduring understandings How will students internalize the standards such that they are linked to an authentically meaningful big picture understanding of the material Information and skills worthy of familiarity What prior knowledge do my students need to make meaning of this new information Important knowledge and skills What foundational knowledge and skills do students need to master this material As teachers select and prioritize these learning expectations they will be guided by thinking about the extent to which the idea topic or process represents a big idea having enduring value beyond the classroom resides at the heart of the discipline and is tied directly to standards and standardized testing requires uncoverage to the extent that parts of these concepts are difficult for students to understand and offers potential for engaging students Align Assessments to the Desired Results Recognizing that standardsbased instruction will be integrated into larger projects and thematic units it is essential that teachers assess mastery in an explicit way Teachers will assess throughout the unit of study using a variety of assessment methods and tools including both formative and summative Methods will include online assessments quizzes or tests aligned with the style Wiggins G McTighe J The Understanding by Design guide to creating highquality units Alexandria VA ASCD A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology students will encounter on standardizedassessments as well as other checks for understanding such as qualitative evaluations student observation conferencing performance tasks and projects Teachers will match an appropriate assessment method to each standard and establish and articulate clear criteria for reaching proficient performance The Chief Academic Officer will oversee and support teachers in their assessment process Differentiate Instruction to Meet the Needs of All Learners Once students learning expectations knowledge and skills have been identified teachers will work together to determine the most effective teaching methods and select the appropriate materials and resources to achieve their goals with all of their students Teachers will design innovative instructional strategies by differentiating the content process and products delivered to students in order to provide equal access for all learners including English Learners and students with special needs Teachers will write effective standards aligned lesson plans and utilize a repertoire of researchbased instructional strategies to increase student achievement Weekly collaborative teacher planning time is written into our schedule to afford teachers the time for these activities Additionally we will provide each student with an Individualized Learning and Development Plan ILDP with annual and interim learning goals progress toward which will be assessed on at least a monthly basis Formative and summative assessment data will inform an individual students academic goals Through collaborative planning times teachers will meet to discuss student goals Teachers will conference with students and parents to seek input and feedback to develop these learning plans As students progress at CTech they will assume greater responsibility for managing their own learning plan under their teachers direction This will require scaffolding over the years to teach and build the habits associated with successful time management and goal attainment Using Data to Inform Instruction CTechs online learning tools will not only provide personalized and targeted learning for all students but will provide critical realtime data for teachers ST Math and Achieve will be utilized at all grade levels to provide teachers and school leaders and parents with frequent measures of student performance As students use these programs data is automatically generated for teachers to see which skills students have mastered and which skills require more instruction These reports are tied directly to state content standards so that summative data show student mastery of specific standards as well as diagnostic data about areas in need of further development Teachers and school leaders can easily aggregate individual subgroup grade level and school wide achievement data in an efficient way so that lessons and professional development can all be tailored directly to student needs As discussed in Elements and of this petition this student achievement data in addition to a variety of formative and summative assessment data generated by endofunit curriculum tests informal checks observationdialogue standards based quiztest openended prompts performance tasks and presentations will be used to develop and refine instructional strategies and provide targeted support to ensure that each and every student is meeting the defined criteria for academic success A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology On a monthly basis the Chief Academic Officer will facilitate data conferences to engage teachers in conversations reflection and planning based on student achievement data In order to support this process teachers will systematically collect and analyze student data on key demographic behavioral and proficiency indicators on a monthly basis We will collect data through the implementation of a robust set of diagnostic and benchmark assessments that complement the state standardized test data including CAASPP and CELDTELPAC data etc and provide continuous information about student progress towards standards The school will implement diagnostic assessments such as the NWEA MAPS These formalized diagnostic assessments will provide data at least three times per year that informs reading levels math placement intervention and enrichment needs and pre and reteaching needs Formative diagnostics will be part of our teaching practice Teachers and students will collaborate to set measurable goals that personalize individual achievements for students of varying abilities Datadriven conversations will also focus on teachergenerated grades to ensure that grading policies are fair equitable and focused on student proficiency as opposed to behavior homework completion or compliance Teachers within each grade level will be provided with monthly common planning time to examine data The Chief Academic Officer will monitor the progress of all subgroups particularly English Learners and special education students and patterns of academic achievement or behavior that may indicate declining progress or inequitable outcomes among different subgroups Any problematic data trends will be directly addressed through meetings with individual teachers and departments and through the examination of policies that may be contributing to declining achievement or inequities At all times teachers will be expected to be able to articulate data patterns in their classrooms and describe what they are doing to raise the achievement of all students and close any gaps that may exist Skillspecific academic needs will be identified through formative and summative assessments and subsequently addressed through direct instruction Phonics reading fluency reading comprehension sentence structure grammar and arithmetic are examples of skill areas that will be introduced and reinforced explicitly by teachers working with students individually in small groups and as a whole class As teachers implement their lesson plans they will continuously be assessing their own efficacy and impact with individual students in the classroom utilizing specific data and analysis of sub groups Instruction will adapt based on student data gathered by the teachers themselves in order to make informed decisions about assessment curriculum pedagogy and student services Teachers will continuously look at student work and questions in order to inform structure and refine their instructional practice Frequent and varied assessments including pre and postassessments of student achievement will provide valuable information to teachers when planning instruction These assessments will serve as relevant data for use by school leadership when making decisions leading to program evaluation and improvement Regular assessment and reporting of student outcomes will also allow interested parties outside of the school to evaluate the academic success of CTech A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Furthermore teachers will have the opportunity to observe their peers teaching to provide feedback to and learn from one another During teacher collaboration time they will share observation feedback and reflect on their practices led by the Chief Academic Officer Based on this inquiry and discussion teachers will calibrate refine curriculum and identify best practices Grading Progress Reporting and PromotionRetention CTech will use two types of grading systems In grades TK CTech will use a standardsbased grading system Students will be evaluated on standard mastery This numeric based system mirrors the states use of measuring standard mastery on a semester schedule In grades C Tech will use a letter grade grading system on a semester schedule Grades TK Grading System A student may score from to Below Standard

the revision unless the revision grade is lower than the original grade Deficiency Notices Deficiency notices will be sent once halfway through each quarter in grade if a students grade is below a C in any class While phone calls and emails are used frequently these deficiency notices serve as a formal notice and are placed in the students file Teachers will also communicate with parentsguardians through emails phone calls and emails It is the responsibility of the teachers to contact parentsguardians if a student is academically low achieving or receiving a C or lower in any course Report Cards and Conferences A Community of st Century Innovators Page of Los Angeles School of Creativity and Technology Students and parents will receive quarter progress reports and semester report cards A variety of conferences will be conducted throughout the school year and include ParentTeacher Conferences These will be scheduled two times per year in person via video chat Facetime etc or teleconference During these conferences parents have the opportunity to share their expectations ask questions and share any concerns they have about their child StudentTeacher Conferences Teachers will regularly confer with their students individually during small group instruction to discuss progress toward goals and provide actionable feedback The teacher will begin with sharing a positive statement about the students academic strengths and share one specific strategy or information actionable feedback that the student can use to continue to grow and achieve Other Conferences Regular communication with parents about student achievement is important at CTech Conferences may be arranged and initiated by the teacher parent or administration throughout the school year to ensure that the academic program is meeting the students needs PromotionRetention Retention is not considered an effective strategy to increase student achievement or to motivate students to learn As a rule students shall be promoted to the following grade at the end of each school year It is the Charter Schools policy to abide by gradelevel placement as determined by birth date If a student is not meeting grade level standards the Charter School believes that it is in the childs best interest to receive additional interventions Therefore it is only considered as a last resort after other avenues have been exhausted and the student is not making adequate progress Students may be considered as not making adequate progress for retention purposes if they are consistently within the bottom of student performance for their class if they have struggled with attempted interventions or no other reasonable explanation can be found for the students lack of progress for example previously undiagnosed learning disability chronic absencestruancy etc Any student being considered for retention must have participated in the SSPT process and it will the recommendation of the SSPT to retain taking into consideration that another year in the same grade will provide the needed intervention for the student In the event a student is retained all documentation will be included in the students cumulative folder If the student transfers or moves to another school the retention paperwork will accompany the student in the cumulative folder Regardless of reasons for retention a student cannot be retained without the consent of the parent or guardian Promotion Ceremonies CTech will recognize Rites of Passage ceremonies These will be similar to the traditional promotion ceremony At the end

Education January TONY THURMOND State Superintendent of Public Instruction Agenda Overview of the California School Dashboard Dashboard and Accountability System The Academic Indicator Deep Dive History Methodology Who does this apply to Participation Rate California Department of Education Overview of the California School Dashboard California Department of Education Dashboard Purpose Supports local educational agencies LEAs and schools by providing information on specific indicators to identify strengths weaknesses and areas needing improvement Indepth analyses on specific areas can be conducted using local data Reports data for all student groups to ensure that each student group is provided the attention and services they need Promotes continuous improvement Standards established to help schools make significant progress California Department of Education Dashboard Indicators Six State Indicators Data collected statewide from local educational agencies LEAs through CALPADS or outside vendors eg Educational Testing Service College Board etc California Department of Education CDE uploads the data into the Dashboard Five Local Indicators Data collected by LEAs LEAs upload the data into the Dashboard Use of Dashboard Data LEAs are required to use the data to inform their local control and accountability plans LCAPs Schools are encouraged to use the data to inform their School Plan for Student Achievement The state uses both local and state indicators to identify LEAs that are eligible for support and uses state indicators to identify schools that are eligible for support The goal is to focus on how to improve outcomes for students California Department of Education How Often is the Dashboard Released The Dashboard is annually released in the fall Because the majority of state indicators use data derived from the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System CALPADS including demographic data for student group determinations it is important that LEAs meet CALPADS certification timelines Once the amendment windows close there are no additional opportunities to correct the data for the Dashboard For Dashboard data was extracted after EndofYear closed September California Department of Education Local Indicators Priority Area Priority Local Indicators Basics Teachers Instructional Materials Facilities Priority Priority Priority Priority Implementation of Academic Standards Parent and Family Engagement Local Climate Survey Access to a Broad Course of Study LEAs Dashboard Coordinators are responsible for uploading information on local indicators in the Dashboard Note Charter schools are considered LEAs under the local control funding formula LCFF and are also required to upload local indicators California Department of Education Local Indicators How Do You Get a Rating Based on whether LEAs met the following requirements Annually measure progress on local performance indicators based on locally available data Report results at a regularly scheduled public meeting of the local governing board Report results to the public through the Dashboard Once indicators are uploaded the status for LEAs will be automatically populated in the Dashboard Met Not Met Not Met for More than Two Years California Department of Education State Indicators by Grade Span State Indicator Chronic Absenteeism Indicator Suspension Rate Indicator Graduation Rate Indicator CollegeCareer Indicator CCI Academic Indicator English Learner Progress Indicator Not reported in Dashboard Status only reported in Dashboard Grade Span K K and California Department of Education NSize Requirements LEAs schools and student groups receive performance levels or colors for each state indicator with at least students in the current and prior year or more determination differs for each state indicator Exception LEAs receive a color for homeless and foster youth if they have at least students in the current and prior year Note Charter schools are treated as schools for Nsize determinations California Department of Education Performance Levels Colors Two years of data Status and Change are required to receive a performance level color Status Current year data Change Difference between current and prioryear data California Department of Education Five Performance Levels Colors The image on the left is an example of the Gauge Indicators from the Highest to the Lowest First Gauge pointing to Blue Second Gauge pointing to Green Third Gauge pointing to Yellow Fourth Gauge pointing to Orange Fifth Gauge pointing to Red California Department of Education How Do You Get a Color The image on the left is a x table showing an example of how to get a color Get a color Green by combining Current year results High and Difference from prior year results Increased California Department of Education Core Rule Used for State Indicators For all state indicators the data are based on data generated at your LEA or school level You dont inherit another LEAs or schools data When students transfer the data that students generated at your LEA or school do not impact the data of the new LEA andor school For example Jason was suspended at your school three times and then transfers to Moonlight School The three suspensions do not follow Jason to Moonlight California Department of Education Small Student Populations Small student populations are more susceptible to large swings in results from year to year Therefore a threebyfive table condensed from a fivebyfive table is applied when N size is less than at the LEA school and student group levels N size is based on different denominators depending on the state indicator Which Indicators Are Eligible for the x Graduation Rate N number of students in the combined fourand fiveyear graduation rate andor the DASS graduation rate Suspension Rate N number of students cumulative enrolled Chronic Absenteeism Rate N number of students who meet the enrollment eligibility CCI N number of students in the combined fourand five year graduation rate andor the DASS graduation rate California Department of Education x Grids NSize or Greater Grids x Grids NSize

charter schools both DASS and nonDASS are not included in their authorizers reports County offices of education COEs that serve only DASS schools receive Dashboard reports based on their DASS schools

of Education The Academic Indicator Deep Dive California Department of Education History California Department of Education SBE Deliberation In November the SBE decided not to release the Academic Indicator using Standard Met or Standard Exceeded voicing concern that the proposed method too closely paralleled the Adequate Yearly Progress AYP methodology which rewarded schools focusing only on those students who were closest to proficient SBE Deliberation Cont Rather the SBE indicated that they wanted a methodology that would encourage districts and schools to improve the academic achievement of all students in the new accountability system Therefore the SBE requested that Department staff develop a methodology using scale scores SBE Deliberation Cont In January SBE meeting the SBE approved the methodology that uses Smarter Balanced scale scores for the Academic Indicator California Department of Education Methodology for the Academic Indicator After reviewing recommendations from the advisory groups feedback from educational stakeholders and the simulations presented using the Smarter Balanced Scale the SBE approved using the Distance from Standard DFS for the Academic Indicator In this methodology each students assessment score is compared to the lowest possible scale score to achieve Level standard met California Department of Education Methodology California Department of Education Overview of the Academic Indicator Grades and Grade Content Areas Assessments English Language Arts Smarter Balanced ELA Mathematics Note California Science Test CAST is not used Summative Assessments SBAC California Alternate Assessments CAAs California Department of Education Display of the ELA CAASPP Scale Score Ranges English language arts California Department of Education Display of the Math CAASPP Scale Score Ranges California Department of Education Distance from Standard DFS Calculates average distance between all student test scores and lowest possible scale score for the Standard Met Achievement Level Level for that grade level Average DFS is calculated for each LEA school and student group Performance levels colors are based on DFS California Department of Education DFS Example Grade Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments in Mathematics A Grade student received a score of Student scored This is points below the lowest possible score for Level The students DFS for mathematics is points points California Department of Education Incorporation of CAAs Under the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA CAA results must be incorporated into the Academic Indicator In September the State Board of Education SBE adopted the topofscalerange methodology to incorporate the CAAs into Distance from Standard DFS calculations beginning with the Dashboard California Department of Education Topofthe ScaleRange For levels on the CAA a students CAA score is substituted with the top score point of the same Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment achievement level oExample Grade three student scoring anywhere in Level on the CAA for ELA would receive the highest score in Level on the ELA Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment which is California Department of Education Status and Change for Dashboard Status Average DFS for All Students Who Took the Smarter Balanced Assessments or CAAs Change Average DFS minus Average DFS To calculate Change the Average DFS was recalculated for the Dashboard to incorporate the new revisions California Department of Education Separate Cut Scores by Grade Spans To date the SBE has approved cut scores based on district and school type for ELA and mathematics Grades Cut Scores Elementary School Middle School K School Elementary School District Unified School District Grade Cut Scores High School serving grades High School District blank blank blank California Department of Education Which students does this apply to California Department of Education Who is included in the Academic Indicator Continuously Enrolled students in grades and Continuous enrollment is defined as enrollment from Fall Census Day [first Wednesday in October] to testing without a gap in enrollment of more than consecutive calendar days Students who take the California Alternate Assessment CAA Students in Dashboard Alternative Status Schools DASS California Department of Education Participation Rate California Department of Education Current Dashboard Penalty for Not Meeting the Participation Rate Applies to All Schools Not meeting the participation rate goal negatively impacts the Distance from Standard DFS which is used to determine performance colors for the Academic Indicator Calculate the number of percentage points that the school LEA or student group falls short of the percent participation target For each of these percentage points reduce the DFS by points The reduction of DFS will vary at the districtwide schoolwide and student group levels California Department of Education Participation Rate for Dashboard US Department of Education ED has determined Californias point penalty does not meet ESSA requirements Beginning with the Dashboard the California Department of Education CDE must assign the Lowest Obtainable Scale Score LOSS for each student needed to bring school district or student group to a percent participation rate California Department of Education New Penalty Methodology For each grade level and content area the distance between the LOSS and Level Standard Met achievement level were calculated Based on the results the smallest distances were o for ELA o for mathematics Using these distances has the least impact on LEAs and schools California Department of Education Example of How the ELA DFS Was Determined Grade Lowest Score in Level LOSS Lowest Score in Level Distance of LOSS from Level How the Mathematics DFS Was Determined Grade Lowest Score in Level LOSS Lowest Score in Level Distance of LOSS from Level California Department of Education SidebySide Comparison The new penalty negatively impacts the DFS and Status level assignments much more than the current penalty For example if a school had a ELA participation rate DFS Without Any Penalty The schools Status level is High DFS Based on Dashboard Participation Rate Penalty The schools Status level remains at High DFS Based on Dashboard Participation Rate Penalty The school drops from High Status to Low Status DFS Difference Between and Penalty California Department of Education Which Students Are Included in Participation Rate Students with parent waivers Included in the denominator of the participation rate o But excluded from the numerator Students enrolled during a schools accountability testing window California Department of Education Which Students Are Removed from Participation Rate Students absent from testing due to a significant medical emergency English learners ELs who have been enrolled in a US school for less than one year are exempt from taking the ELA Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments Any EL newcomer enrolled after April are automatically removed All ELs are expected to take the mathematics assessments and are included in the math participation rate California Department of Education Questions California Department of Education TAB Growth and School Information How the Los Angeles Unified approach to
