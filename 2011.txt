LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Report Number Date January Subject Special Education Local Plan Area SELPA Reorganization Responsible Staff Name Sharyn Howell OfficeDivision Division of Special Education Telephone No BOARD REPORT Action Proposed Background The LAUSD Board of Education is requested to approve a reorganization of the LAUSD Special Education Local Plan Area SELPA which will provide charter schools with flexibility and autonomy in providing special education services while ensuring that students with disabilities within the LAUSD geographic boundaries are provided access to programs and services at both Districtoperated and Charteroperated schools in compliance with federal and state laws and the Modified Consent Decree The intent of the reorganization is to put mechanisms in place that encourage all schools to enroll and support students with disabilities The purpose of a SELPA is to assure that the necessary range of educational programs are available to students with disabilities within their service areas and to support member Local Education Agencies LEAs in the implementation of legal requirements associated with the IDEA and state special education law Each SELPA is required to submit a local plan to the State that includes a description of the required range of services available in the SELPA describes the governance structure of the SELPA and demonstrates that students with disabilities will have access to any of the services required in order to receive a free appropriate public education FAPE In January the State Board of Education SBE approved the California Department of Educations CDE recommendations to expand options for charter schools to gain membership in SELPA regionalization models Specifically the SBE approved three SELPA models developed by a CDE task force including a within county SELPA an outside county SELPA and a stateregionalized SELPA It is the Districts position that the SBE did not have the legal authority to change the States SELPA organization Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report During the school year the CDE approved twentyone charter schools to be members of the El Dorado County Charter SELPA The total includes eighteen Alliance schools and three Aspire Schools In July approximately seventy additional charteroperated schools submitted written notice of their intent to exit the LAUSD SELPA in July to join an out of District SELPA Many of the SELPAs that would potentially accept Districtauthorized charters are geographically distant from LAUSD Membership in these other SELPAs requires that the charter school become an LEA for purposes of special education As an LEA the charter school is required to act as a public school district which requires it to assume the full responsibility for providing special education programs and services to students with disabilities and for providing those students a FAPE The charter school must also demonstrate the program and fiscal capacity experience base and infrastructure in order to be deemed an LEA The SELPAs admitting charter schools as an LEA would act solely as an Administrative Unit and do not assume responsibility for providing services for students with disabilities attending a member charter school In order to make this change in status a charter school is required to provide the District with at least one year of notice and meet other transition requirements identified by CDE Ed Code see also CDE guidance re charter participation in SELPA The exodus of charter schools from the LAUSD SELPA has negative consequences for students families and the District Families and students with disabilities will often be represented in areas of special education by a SELPA that may be a long distance from the families home school district Therefore parent interactions including trainings parent meetings and opportunities to interface directly with staff may be a challenge for many families The charter school as an LEA will be responsible for all special education issues including services placement due process related services special education classes and special education supports The LAUSD SELPA and District personnel will no longer be involved with the IEP process or in the provision of services for the students attending these out of geographic area SELPA charter schools The District will be responsible however for monitoring these charter school LEAs progress on the MCD outcomes and compliance with federal and state laws as long as the schools are authorized by LAUSD Although the District no longer has the ultimate responsibility for provision of FAPE to students enrolled in an LEA charter as the authorizing agency LAUSD is responsible for ensuring that a charter school designated as its own LEA meets all requirements of law in delivery of special education to any student with disabilities that attends a District authorized school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Districts receive special education funds based on Average Daily Attendance ADA of all students Special education funds are not allocated to school districts based on the students with disabilities served by the district As general education students leave the District the revenues generated to provide services to students with disabilities also decrease This becomes significant if charter schools do not enroll and serve students with disabilities at the same level and with the same eligibilities as District schools while receiving both the general and special education funding through ADA In order to ensure that students with disabilities have access to programs at all schools and programs authorized by the District the District and charter school communities collaborated on the development of a new SELPA organization which would provide a viable option for charter schools to remain in the LAUSD SELPA The proposed reorganization would retain the singleDistrict SELPA status of LAUSD as in the current structure but would create two subsets of schools Districtoperated and charteroperated under the administration of one single Administrative Unit The charteroperated schools would not have LEA status but would function in a similar role in that each charter school would be responsible for all special education issues including services placement due process related services special education classes and special education supports Charter schools would apply for membership in the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA These schools would be required to meet a set of structured criteria including demonstrated capacity to serve students with disabilities prior to being admitted to the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA These schools would receive support from a Special Education Director for the Charteroperated Programs Districtoperated schools would continue to receive the supports and services that they currently receive from the Division of Special Education Charter schools not meeting the criteria for admission to the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA will remain under the Districtoperated Program section of the SELPA and will have two options for membership These schools may act like a Districtoperated school for purposes of special education or they may chose to provide their own programs and services and be reimbursed for these services based on a percentage of their general fund contribution The reorganization of the SELPA would retain a central Administrative Unit to include Due Process FiscalProgram Accountability Compliance and Nonpublic Schools and Agencies The reorganization would not create a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report new administrative branch of the Division of Special Education but would utilize existing resources An Advisory Board consisting of five members appointed by the Board of Education recommended by the Districtoperated Programs recommended by the Charteroperated Programs provides charteroperated schools with a voice in the governance of special education in LAUSD This Advisory Board would provide input guidance and support to the SELPA Administrator in the Administrative Unit in coordinating programs and services across both District and charter schools This Advisory Board would also inform the Superintendent and Board of Education regarding special education issues The diagram below describes the structure of the proposed SELPA Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Expected Outcomes Board Options and Consequences Policy Implications The benefits to this reorganization include Provides charter schools with the flexibility and autonomy to fully operate and be accountable for their special education programs Provides charter schools with the opportunity to participate in SELPAlevel decisions affecting their school Provides LAUSD revenue from charteroperated schools to be applied toward administrative costs of special education Allows charter and Districtoperated schools to mutually benefit from the programs services and expertise available in both District operated and charteroperated programs Builds capacity for charter and Districtoperated schools to serve all students with disabilities regardless of eligibility Ensures that families of students with disabilities are provided access to supports and services within their geographic area This reorganization of the SELPA is simply a first step in a process of ensuring that students with disabilities have access to schools of choice and to the supports and services that they need to be successful There are many factors still to be addressed such as the fair share contribution to the general fund for those charter schools that remain within the LAUSD Districtoperated Program section of the SELPA Similarly regulations guidelines and procedures must be established in the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA to ensure that more students with disabilities receive the services that they need in order to access the programs If options within the LAUSD SELPA are not available for charter schools they will continue to seek to exit the SELPA and join an out of district SELPA This will be detrimental to students with disabilities and to the District and creates potential liability in the light of the Districts concern that the geographically distant SELPA model is inconsistent with law which requires that local plans must assure access to special education and services for all individuals with exceptional needs residing in geographic area served by the plan and service area The current Special Education Local Plan will need to be rewritten with input from the Community Advisory Committee CAC and Special Education Multicultural Advisory Committee SEMAC for submission to the Board of Education and SBE for approval Guidelines will need to be developed and refined to ensure that the new SELPA organization equitably meets the needs of students with disabilities It is recommended that data be analyzed annually over a three year period with a report submitted to the Board of Education annually to inform the Board regarding the successes and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report challenges regarding this reorganization During the school year a report will be provided to the Board of Education to assist the Board in determining whether this reorganization is producing the desired results for students with disabilities in an effective and cost efficient manner Budget Impact There is a significant fiscal impact on the Districts capacity to fund special education programs due to the declining general education population As charter schools leave the LAUSD SELPA this fiscal impact increases Currently the District withholds or of the AB and IDEA funds from charter schools towards a fair share contribution for the District wide costs of special education Charter schools have not contributed from their general fund for Districtwide special education costs although some charter schools have used their general fund for services for their students With the proposed reorganization this funding model would be extended through fiscal year FY for those charter schools who indicate that they will remain on the Districtoperated Program section of the SELPA A fair share contribution will be determined by the Board of Education during the FY to be implemented in FY The additional year at this funding level will provide these schools with time to determine whether they wish to remain in the Districtoperated Program or move to the Charteroperated Program section of the LAUSD SELPA Charter schools that select to join the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA will contribute of their AB rate includes Base Supplement to Base COLA GrowthDecline of Program SpecialistRegionalized Services and their Federal IDEA In FY this is estimated to be per student Of this amount will be allocated to support the existing Districtwide administration of special education supports and services including infantspreschooler students and year old students with disabilities not currently served by charter schools The other will be allocated as directed by the Advisory Board and members of the Charteroperated Program with the leadership of the Charteroperated Program special education director These funds will be used to support the personnel for the Charteroperated Program section of the SELPA build management and operating procedures to create an infrastructure to support schools in meeting the needs of students with mild to severe disabilities and to create and implement new programs that serve students in charter schools Districtoperated schools do not receive AB or IDEA funding These funds are used centrally to provide supports and services to approximately Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report students served in Districtoperated schools Additionally for FY the general fund contribution for Districtoperated schools was approximately per ADA For FY it is projected to be per ADA In FY independent charter schools served approximately students with disabilities out of a total of students Most of these students were students with mild to moderate disabilities With a projected student base of students in the Charteroperated Program the anticipated loss in revenue from the current model will be approximately M based on or being retained for Districtwide costs However if the same charter school students leave the LAUSD SELPA in FY the anticipated loss in revenue would be M Annually data will be analyzed in terms of numbers of students with disabilities enrolled types of services provided eligibilities of students served increased capacity to serve students with moderate to severe disabilities and compliance with federal and state laws as well as the Outcomes of the MCD to determine whether the reorganization model of the SELPA is effective and whether the funding model is appropriate Special education revenues are inadequate for funding the programs and services required by students with disabilities Major determinates in a schools decision to become a charter school or to leave a SELPA revolve around autonomy and fiscal issues As long as special education remains a largely underfunded mandate it will be difficult to encourage schools to stay within the SELPA or to enroll and provide the necessary services for a student with moderate to severe disabilities This reorganization is an attempt to partially address these two issues while recognizing that legislation and funding regarding special education need to

minimum criteria set forth in Education Code b for schools in operation at least four years Attained its Academic Performance Index API growth target in the prior year or in two of the last three years or in the aggregate for the prior three years or Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API in the prior year or in two of the last three years or Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API for a demographically comparable school in the prior year or in two of the last three years or A The entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school B The determination made pursuant to this paragraph shall be based upon all of the following i Documented and clear and convincing data ii Pupil achievement data from assessments including but not limited to the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program established by Article commencing with Section for demographically similar pupil populations in the comparison schools iii Information submitted by the charter school nimo Watts

ratings An evaluation of accomplished applies to operations characterized overall by strengths There are very few weaknesses and any that do exist do not diminish the students experience While an evaluation of accomplished represents a high standard of operating it is a standard that should be achievable in all schools It implies that it is fully appropriate for a school to continue its operations without significant Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report adjustment The school would always be expected to continue to take advantage of opportunities to improve however An evaluation of proficient applies to operations characterized by a number of strengths There are weaknesses but neither singly nor collectively do these have a significant adverse impact on the student experience An evaluation of proficient may be arrived at in a number of circumstances The school may provide a productive student experience but it may not provide consistent challenge for students Typically operations will be characterized by strengths but one or more weaknesses reduce the overall quality of the student experience An evaluation of developing applies to operations characterized by weaknesses which require remedial action by the school Some if not all staff responsible for the operation evaluated as inadequate require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement There may be some strengths but these are overshadowed by the impact of the weaknesses An evaluation of unsatisfactory applies when there are major weaknesses in operation that require immediate remedial action on the part of the school The student experience is at risk in significant respects In almost all cases staff responsible for operations evaluated unsatisfactory will require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement This may involve working alongside effective peers in or beyond the school Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Student Achievement and Educational Performance at the school to be developing Areas of particular strength include The schools Growth API is a point growth from the Base API of A focus group of eleven students was held and the students reported that teachers make class fun stay after school to provide tutoring and are always encouraging students to do better The school has made a concerted effort to maintain a compliant program for students with disabilities to hold IEPs within timelines and with the appropriate personnel and to distribute the required forms and brochures Areas recommended for improvement include According to the CDE in of the schools students were English Learners but none were redesignated as Fluent English Proficient The visiting team did not see SDAIE strategies in wide use School should work to maintain a redesignation rate closer to or exceeding the district average The school is in Year One of Program Improvement and demonstrates plans to build teacher capacity through professional development However the visiting team would recommend an increased sense of urgency in increasing the level of academic rigor in lessons While the school has a literacy focus this year classroom environments are not particularly printrich and there lacked artifacts of student writing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The team read a highly organized professional development plan However the areas covered were not evident in teacher practice Interviewed teachers did say that the use of student acheivement data to guide instruction is an area of need II Governance and Organizational Management Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Governance and Organizational Management at the school to be developing Areas of particular strength include A focus group was held with eight parents Parents praised the school for providing a clean and orderly learning environment They said that all staff are friendly and communicative Areas recommended for improvement include The one area in particularly need for improvement based upon the MCD Progress Reports is lowering the suspension rate for students with disabilities from to at or below the district target of Board meetings could more closely adhere to Brown Act requirements in several ways First every agenda for meetings should provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the board on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Green Dot Public Schools Additionally agendas should include information regarding how to whom and when a request for disabilityrelated modification or accommodation including auxiliary aids or services may be made by a person with a disability who requires a modification or accommodation in order to participate in the public meeting Agenda items need to listed with enough specificity that a member of the public can reasonably decide if she wants to monitor the meeting While board member participation by telephone is permissible under the Brown Act conditions this should happen under do not appear have to been honored in past meetings Human resources recordkeeping appears to have substantially improved However Green Dot home office needs to ensure that documents such as evidence of TB clearance are available in of cases III Fiscal Operations Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Fiscal Operations at the school to be proficient Areas of particular strength include Positive Net assets of audit and unaudited actuals Fiscally supportive and strong Charter Management Organization Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Areas recommended for improvement include Improve accuracy of the preliminary reports when compared to the audit Negative net income projected for and Net assets will remain positive Reserve of is the Innovation and Charter Schools Division recommends a reserve IV Fulfillment of the Charter Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Fulfillment of the Charter at the school to be developing Areas of particular strength include Green Dot schools operate under six common tenets schools that are small safe and personalized high expectations for all students with all students meeting ag requirements as part of graduation local control with extensive professional development and accountability parent participation with a variety of programs provided to parents dollars placed into the classroom and schools open later The school has excelled on the front of creating a personalized environment Students called the school a second family and one called the principal a second mom Areas recommended for improvement include The least operationalized of the six Green Dot tenets is that of parent participation with the variety of opportunies Parents say that in the past parent meetings were held sporadically and that they have not been offered workshops A new parent coordinator has made parent education a major goal for this year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

HIGH SCHOOL BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January I Category of Proposed Action The proposed action would renew the charter for nimo Watts Charter High School and provide a final total of approximately students in grades during the five year term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the Court Ordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The approval of this charter petition would grant the charter of nimo Watts Charter High School for five years beginning July IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options

Innovation and Charter Schools Division INFORMATIVE DATE January SUBJECT ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE DATA ON FOUR GREEN DOT RENEWAL SCHOOLS On Tuesday January the board will be asked to take action on four Green Dot High Schools that are due for renewal nimo Ralph Bunche nimo Locke Tech nimo Jackie Robinson and nimo Watts The purpose of this informative is to provide additional information about the schools Specifically this informative summarizes how these schools discipline and expel students the extent to which these schools serve disabled students and the extent to which these schools serve English Learners STUDENT DISCIPLINE Discipline and expulsion policies used at District schools must comply with California Education Code While the charter school mega waiver Education Code exempts charter schools from these requirements the discipline and expulsion practices of Green Dot schools are highly aligned with those of the district The grounds for suspension and expulsion published in nimo schools parentstudent handbooks are identical to those listed in Education Code et seq Likewise those student offenses that district principals must recommend expulsion for Category I are identical to those for which Green Dot principals must recommend expulsions A District expulsion hearing is conducted by an Expulsion Review Committees composed of staff from schools other than the one at which the student in question is enrolled Likewise a Green Dot expulsion hearing is conducted by the Green Dot Discipline Review Panel which is composed of Green Dot staff teachers and administrators that do not serve at the school at which the student in question is enrolled Just as parentsguardians of students facing expulsion from District schools receive written notices of their due process rights and alleged student violations the same holds true for Green Dot parentguardians although the same forms may not be used Families of students expelled by the Green Dot Discipline Review Panel can appeal the expulsion ruling to the entire Green Dot Public Schools Board During the school year no students were expelled from nimo Locke Tech nimo Jackie Robinson or nimo Watts Three students were expelled from nimo Ralph Bunche for the reason of disruptionwillful violence As of the date of this report none of the four renewing Green Dot schools has expelled any student during the

English Learners at rates comparable to the District as a whole While they schools struggled at the beginning with redesignating English Learners they now do so at rates comparable with the District with nimo Jackie Robinson redesignating students at an especially high rate FACILITIES The District has worked collaboratively with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety LADBS to obtain assurances that the certificate of occupancy issued for the applicable school meets the accessibility requirements of the law In order to obtain this assurance the District has coordinated with LADBS to have the schools reinspected and to ensure compliance under the terms of the Modified Consent Decree Each school is required to provide proof to the District that all material access compliance

DISTRICT Board of Education Report A SUMMARY OF SCHOOL PERFORMANCE The Innovation and Charter Schools Division has analyzed the performance of the charter school using established criteria in the following four areas I Student Achievement and Educational Performance II Governance and Organizational Management III Fiscal Operations IV Fulfillment of the Charter I Student Achievement and Educational Performance First the Innovation and Charter Schools Division has confirmed whether or not the charter school has met at least one of the following minimum criteria set forth in Education Code b for schools in operation at least four years Attained its Academic Performance Index API growth target in the prior year or in two of the last three years or in the aggregate for the prior three years or Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API in the prior year or in two of the last three years or Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API for a demographically comparable school in the prior year or in two of the last three years or A The entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school B The determination made pursuant to this paragraph shall be based upon all of the following i Documented and clear and convincing data ii Pupil achievement data from assessments including but not limited to the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program established by Article commencing with Section for demographically similar pupil populations in the comparison schools iii Information submitted by the charter school Note If a charter school has not been in operation for at least four years this section of Education Code serves as reference The Innovation and Charter Schools Division will present findings based on its performance analysis of the schools data to date and of the academic operational and fiscal soundness of the charter school based on the Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight nimo Locke Tech Charter High School has met the minimum statutory

of Resident Schools English Language Arts and Math and higher than Median of Comparison Schools and Charter English Language Arts and Math Following are definitions of the School Performance Evaluation ratings An evaluation of accomplished applies to operations characterized overall by strengths There are very few weaknesses and any that do exist do not diminish the students experience While an evaluation of accomplished represents a high standard of operating it is a standard that should be achievable in all schools It implies that it is fully appropriate for a school to continue its operations without significant adjustment The school would always be expected to continue to take advantage of opportunities to improve however An evaluation of proficient applies to operations characterized by a number of strengths There are weaknesses but neither singly nor collectively do these have a significant adverse impact on the student experience An evaluation of proficient may be arrived at in a number of circumstances The school may provide a productive student experience but it may not provide consistent challenge for students Typically operations will be characterized by strengths but one or more weaknesses reduce the overall quality of the student experience An evaluation of developing applies to operations characterized by weaknesses which require remedial action by the school Some if not all staff responsible for the operation evaluated as inadequate require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement There may be some strengths but these are overshadowed by the impact of the weaknesses An evaluation of unsatisfactory applies when there are major weaknesses in operation that require immediate remedial action on the part of the school The student experience is at risk in significant Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report respects In almost all cases staff responsible for operations evaluated unsatisfactory will require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement This may involve working alongside effective peers in or beyond the school Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Student Achievement and Educational Performance at the school to be developing Areas of particular strength include The schools new principal has set an aggressive goal to reach a score of at least next year Focus groups of seven parents and seven of the high schools seniors were conducted Both groups had a high level of confidence that the school was doing a superior job of preparing students for college Parents reported that teachers were very communicative and easy to contact in person by phone and via email Students reported that teachers make sure students do the work and do not let students slip through the cracks One student referred to the teachers as second parents Areas recommended for improvement include According to the CDE in of the schools students were English Learners and were redesignated as Fluent English Proficient SDAIE strategies were not seen in wide use School should work to maintain a redesignation rate closer to the district average Likewise the percentage of students identified as students with disabilities is low and the school should ensure that they are not underidentified in need of these services In the majority of classrooms observed teachers were calling only on volunteers to answer questions or students were working in groups on activities that were not structured to ensure every member of the group was accountable for learning More systematic checking for understanding has a potential to improve academic results A focus group of eight teachers reports that they are just now establishing protocols for examining student data on a regular basis It is critical that this initiative is supported As soon as possible the school needs to distribute Are You Puzzled About Your Childs Special Needs to parents of all students Ensure that IEPs are held with all appropriate personnel such as assessors and general education teachers and that IEPs contain the appropriate certification pages Distribute the Report of Progress for students with disabilities at the same time and frequency as the general education progress reportsreport cards The MCD Progress Reports reflect that the school needs to increase parent participation at IEP meetings and decrease its rate of suspensions for students with disabilities II Governance and Organizational Management Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Governance and Organizational Management at the school to be developing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Areas of particular strength include Interviewed parents praised the staff for being friendly and communicative Parents also stated that they found the school to be a safe place They believe that the new principal and leadership are are an improvement over the past administration Students stated the new principal was much better than past principals A focus group of eight teachers stated that the administrative team finally seems to be functional Areas recommended for improvement include Address parent concerns over a high level of teacher and principal turnover Parents seemed to have little information about how Green Dot and the school are governed and this represents an opportunity to increase parent participation Board meetings could more closely adhere to Brown Act requirements in several ways First every agenda for meetings should provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the board on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Green Dot Public Schools Additionally agendas should include information regarding how to whom and when a request for disabilityrelated modification or accommodation including auxiliary aids or services may be made by a person with a disability who requires a modification or accommodation in order to participate in the public meeting Agenda items need to listed with enough specificity that a member of the public can reasonably decide if she wants to monitor the meeting While board member participation by telephone is permissible under the Brown Act conditions this should happen under do not appear have to been honored in past meetings Human resources recordkeeping appears to have substantially improved However Green Dot home office needs to ensure that documents such as evidence of TB clearance are available in of cases III Fiscal Operations Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Fiscal Operations at the school to be proficient Areas of particular strength include Positive Net assets of audit and unaudited actuals Fiscally supportive and strong Charter Management Organization Areas recommended for improvement include Improve accuracy of the preliminary reports when compared to the audit Cash reserve of Innovation and Charter Schools Division recommends increase to Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report IV Fulfillment of the Charter Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Fulfillment of the Charter at the school to be proficient Areas of particular strength include The school operationalizes the majority of the six Green Dot tenets and makes good on providing a small safe and personalized collegeprep program Areas recommended for improvement include The least operationalized of the six Green Dot tenets is that of parent participation with the variety of opportunies Parents say that in the past parent meetings were held sporatically and that they have never been offered workshops Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Respectfully submitted APPROVED BY RAMON C CORTINES

nimo Locke Tech Charter High School and provide a final total of approximately students in grades during the five year term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to

this charter petition would grant the charter of nimo Locke Tech Charter High School for five years beginning July IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various

principals must recommend expulsion for Category I are identical to those for which Green Dot principals must recommend expulsions A District expulsion hearing is conducted by an Expulsion Review Committees composed of staff from schools other than the one at which the student in question is enrolled Likewise a Green Dot expulsion hearing is conducted by the Green Dot Discipline Review Panel which is composed of Green Dot staff teachers and administrators that do not serve at the school at which the student in question is enrolled Just as parentsguardians of students facing expulsion from District schools receive written notices of their due process rights and alleged student violations the same holds true for Green Dot parentguardians although the same forms may not be used Families of students expelled by the Green Dot Discipline Review Panel can appeal the expulsion ruling to the entire Green Dot Public Schools Board During the school year no students were expelled from nimo Locke Tech nimo Jackie Robinson or nimo Watts Three students were expelled from nimo Ralph Bunche for the reason of disruptionwillful violence As of the date of this report none of the four renewing Green Dot schools has expelled any student during the current school year SPECIAL EDUCATION According to CBEDS data the renewing Animo high schools enroll Special Education students at below the

they now do so at rates comparable with the District with nimo Jackie Robinson redesignating students at an especially high rate FACILITIES The District has worked collaboratively with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety LADBS to obtain assurances that the certificate of occupancy issued for the applicable school meets the accessibility requirements of the law In order to obtain this assurance the District has coordinated with LADBS to have the schools reinspected and to ensure compliance under the terms of the Modified Consent Decree Each school is required to provide proof to the District that all material access compliance issues set forth in the attached Order to Comply have been resolved by June You will note language in board reports reflecting this requirement This language does not apply to schools colocated on district property ie Animo Jackie Robinson at Clinton MS Finally our facilities team is working to coordinate with other jurisdictions for schools outside of LA City ie Animo Watts which is located in an unincorporated part of the County Applicable language will be added in those cases Thank you c John Deasy Michelle King David Holmquist Wendy

ColeGutirrez Director Charter Schools OfficeDivision Innovation and Charter Schools Division Telephone No BOARD REPORT Action Proposed Staff recommends the following action Background Denial of the Charter Petition for Marells Preparatory Academy Staff proposes that the Board of Education deny the charter petition for Marells Preparatory Academy on the grounds that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements as set forth in Education Code section bA P It is also recommended that the Board of Education adopt the Findings of Fact supporting the recommendation on file in the Innovation and Charter Schools Division and attached to this board report On

are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the petition lacked reasonably comprehensive descriptions of elements set forth in Education Code section bAP Education Code section b sets forth grounds for denying a charter petition The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of section or The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the sixteen elements set forth in section b Subsequent to the petitioners request for a public hearing before the Board of Education elements were reviewed by staff of the Innovation and Charter Schools Division and elements were reviewed by the Superintendents Advisory Committee and the Office of General Counsel Elements and were found to be not reasonably comprehensive The petition is not reasonably comprehensive in these areas for multiple issues including conflicts of interest noncompliance with the Brown Act and lack of comprehensive suspension and expulsion procedures The budget for the proposed charter school was reviewed by the Innovation and Charter Schools Divisions fiscal staff Petitioners fail to present a viable budget and realistic financial and operational plan for the successful implementation of the proposed charter school Detailed reviews of the charter petition and budget are submitted in the Findings of Fact accompanying this Board Report The petition is available for perusal in the Innovation and Charter Schools Division Expected Outcomes Denial will prevent the establishment of Marells Preparatory Academy as an LAUSD authorized charter school at this time Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Board Options and Consequences Yes The approval of the denial of the charter of Marells Preparatory Academy would prevent the establishment of Marells Preparatory Academy as a charter school unless Marells Preparatory Academy appeals the denial and the appeal is granted by the Los Angeles County Board of Education or California State Board of Education No The failure to deny the charter of Marells Preparatory Academy could allow Marells Preparatory Academy to operate as a LAUSD authorized charter school Policy Implications The Policy for Charter Schools adopted in Budget Impact State Revenue Limit income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school and comparable or offsetting expenditure savings may not occur in such cases Under Education Code section c a school district that grants a charter to or operates a charter school that is formed as a non profit public benefit corporation is not held liable for the charter schools debts or obligations as long as the school district complies with all oversight responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and supervisory responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter schools petition or operations with significant financial implications would require District approval prior to implementation Petition approval is also contingent upon adequate liability insurance coverage Issues and

Marells Preparatory Academy Charter Petition Findings of Fact for Denial of Petition By the Los Angeles Unified School District The charter review process requires the authorizer to evaluate whether the charter petition meets the criteria for approval Education Code Section b states the required petition Element s and conditions for denial Education Code Section outlines additional petition criteria The Petition of Marells Preparatory Academy Charter School does not meet the criteria under Education Code section b Education Code section b states A school district governing board shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice Education code section b provides that the governing board shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required Element s LAUSDs analysis of the charter petition submitted on or about November to LAUSD by Marells Preparatory Academy indicates Regarding above The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The revenue sources relied upon by the charter school in its startup Budget Plan have not been secured The school is relying on receipt of a Public School Grant Program award from the State but has not been awarded a grant at this time Additionally the startup budget includes funds from the Revolving Loan for Charter Schools Although the school is eligible to apply due to limited funds there is no guarantee that the loan will be approved Petitioners do not have proof of securing any other source of startup funds Accordingly petitioners fail to present a viable budget and realistic financial and operational plan for the successful implementation of the proposed charter school The petitioner did not provide evidence that funds from the Personal Loan identified in the budget plan have been secured Lack of secured funds negatively impacts the petitioners ability to successfully implement the program Regarding above The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code Charter petition does not comply with California Education Code section d which requires a charter to affirm that it would not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education Code section disability gender nationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section of the Penal Code The charter petition only affirms that it would admit pupils without regard to ethnicity race or national origin Regarding above The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all of the Elements required in EC b based on the following findings of fact Description of the Schools Educational Program Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools educational program Daily schedules do not depict course offerings for every grade at timesperiods specified Measurable Student Outcomes Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools measureable student outcomes Performance indicators and skills knowledge and attitudes are not clearly described or defined in the proposed School Accountability Plan The APIs listed for comparison schools are not accurate Governance Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools governance The charter contains statements indicating that financially interested persons may serve on the governing board of the charter school as long as the interested person discloses the conflict and abstain from participating in the transaction Any transaction entered into with a financially interested person would be in violation of Government Code section and would render such transaction void The charter contains statements regarding the governing boards responsibilities but does not sufficiently explain who will have the authority to approve contracts and purchases of or less without board approval It also does not describe what checks and balances will be in place to guard against potential abuses of this policy Bylaws a Brown Act Article of the Bylaws describes a potential Brown Act conflict that exists regarding Place of Meetings that may conflict with Government Code section b which requires subject to the exceptions listed in that statute that all regular and special meetings be held within the boundaries of the territory over which the Board has jurisdiction Article of the charter schools Bylaws under the heading Notices provides that the boards Annual Meetings and Regular Meetings may be held without notice The Brown Act requires that the Board provide at least hours advance notice of a regular meeting along with an agenda The agenda shall specify the time and location of the regular meeting and shall be posted in a location that is freely accessible to members of the public Gov Code Since the allowable procedure under Article may violate the notice requirements of the Brown Act we recommend that LAUSD advise the charter school to revise this section so notice of board meetings is required Additionally Article conflicts with which states that agendas for regular board meetings will be posted hours in advance of the meeting Article of the Bylaws regarding notice of special meetings only addresses notice to directors of the Board and not the public While the Brown Act does allow special meetings to be called at any time notice of the meeting must be given to the public at least hours before the special meeting Article provides that if a quorum is initially present [but less than a quorum become present] the Board may continue to transact business as long as any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the quorum required Per the California Attorney General Brown Act publication when there is less than a quorum present at a noticed meeting the body may either meet as a committee or adjourn to a future date The presence of a quorum is necessary to take action Govt Code b Conflict of Interest The charter schools Bylaws Article under Election states the MPA Principal shall be a nonvoting member of the Board Government Code section et seq precludes a charter school Principal assuming heshe is a paid employee of the charter school from also serving on the charter schools Board of Directors regardless of whether heshe is a non voting member Hisher presence on the charter schools governing board prohibits the governing board from taking action Article of the Bylaws allows up to of the corporate Board members to be interested persons Article defines an interested person as a director etc who has a direct or indirect financial interest Article c states A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest and Article allows the Board to take action even if a conflict exists Under Government Code section a Board may not take action if an interested person serves on the Board The bylaws accordingly as stated may run afoul of Government Code Article states A voting member of the government board who receives compensation directly or indirectly from the Organization for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that members compensation This Bylaw allows board members to receive compensation for services provided they do not participate in the vote regarding their compensation Not only does Article conflict with Article which states Board Members shall serve without compensation but since Board member compensation is a material financial interest there may be a Section violation Government Code section et seq prohibits governing board members from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity or by the board of which they are members A conflict of interest in a contracttransaction per Section results in a void contract and the steps the board may take per the Bylaw Sections will not cure that conflict An interested board member is conclusively presumed to have made the contract for purposes of Section because heshe is on the board resulting in a void contract Racial and Ethnic Balance Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools racial and ethnic balance provisions Statement in Element does not comply with California Education Code section d which requires a charter to affirm that it would not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education Code section disability gender nationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section of the Penal Code The charter petition only states that it would admit pupils without regard to ethnicity race or national origin The racial and ethnic content does not sufficiently describe how the charter will attain a racial and ethnic balance reflective of LAUSD including a written plan that provides dates and locations of meetings and events Admission Requirements Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools admission requirements provisions The lottery procedure described in the charter petition does not comport with Ed Code dB which requires a public random drawing process if the number of those students who wish to attend the charter school exceeds the schools capacity The charter petition incorrectly states that a lottery will be implemented if it exceeds capacity or attendance The admission requirements content does not describe efforts to recruit academically low achieving economically disadvantaged and special needs students Suspension and Expulsion Procedures Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools suspension and expulsion procedures provisions The petition lists grounds for which a student may be suspended or expelled without differentiating discretionary vs nondiscretionary offenses Furthermore the petition confusingly includes in its list of causes for which a student may be suspended or expelled several offenses which require mandatory expulsion recommendations under Section Failure to differentiate mandatory suspension and expulsion recommendations for the more serious offenses listed in Section calls into question whether the proposed procedures will provide adequate safety for students and staff of the school Under Suspension Procedures the petition states that a school employee shall make a reasonable effort to contact the parentguardian at time of students suspension The charter school needs to specifically identify the individual who is responsible to ensure that this procedure is followed Furthermore the petition states that the notice may also state the date and time of when the student may return to school Providing this information should not be discretionary to ensure proper notification and due process to parents and students The petition fails to state that a student may appeal an expulsion order and the procedures in filing an appeal and what panel would hear the appeal Failure to include expulsion appeal process in the petition does not ensure due process for students The petition fails to describe what occurs after the expulsion hearing takes place including notice of expulsion with information to the parent and student on reason for expulsion term of expulsion rehabilitation plan reinstatement date options for enrollment and information on how to obtain pupil records Retirement Programs Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools retirement programs provisions The charter school has not identified staff responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements for STRS PERS or Social Security coverage procedures
