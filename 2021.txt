REQUEST TO AMEND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT Student Impact The work on budget transparency is supporting the community of schools by designing the Districts budget and financial statements to support the new District structure Making the budget easier to understand will allow school administrators to focus on student outcomes The development of student centered funding formula will increase the support provided to our high needs students In addition the work done on COVID testing plan will make it safer for students to return to a physical classroom Introduction Many concerns have been raised about the complexity in understanding the Districts budget and financial statements These concerns need to be addressed and we are therefore tasked to produce simple to understand budgets and financial statements for senior leaders management parents school communities and the public Mr Johnson is helping in providing a mapping to convert the complex financial data into what is simple and easy to understand He has been working on developing a roadmap of financial reporting requirements determining areas of improvements and advising on the Districts open data portal The portal includes a dashboard for stakeholders to explore District and schoollevel budget and expenditure data Now that school operations are being decentralized to the communities of schools where the support for schools is aimed at being in the core of the community it is imperative that financial information is simple in order that schools make the right decisions in allocating resources to ensure equity and maximize the benefit to their students and to support District goals Mr Johnson coordinated preparation of the Districts application for the USDEs New Grants Under the WellRounded Education through StudentCentered Funding Demonstration Grants Program CFDA E The purpose of the program is to provide competitive grants to LEAs to demonstrate model programs for providing wellrounded education opportunities through the development and implementation of studentcentered funding systems based on weighted perpupil allocations under section of the ESEA Elementary and Secondary Education Act Mr Johnson will assist in developing the studentcentered funding system Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January One of Mr Johnsons important role is his involvement in the overall strategy on preparing and messaging across all aspects of the Districts COVID testing program This work included a model to determine per day testing capacity by vendor used to determine the testing plan for re opening schools Scenario modeling and projections on implementing a districtwide COVID testing program has also been developed to enable district leadership to understand tradeoffs and pressures on district and vendor capacity Financial impacts on models of multiple testing scenarios including third party costs and internal LAUSD costs of testing program has been valuable in the decision making process Mr Johnson has provided documentation on dataflow and system architecture and contributed in identifying and developing plans to mitigate risk and issues which is a key component of the planning process Mr Johnson has been coordinating interaction with Medical University partners including UCLA Stanford and Johns Hopkins University and Anthem Healthcare Why is this necessary This amendment will extend the contract to continue the work on improved new reporting and analysis process and outputs of LAUSDs finances The work includes assessment of the current state of financial planning and analysis team capacity and work products engaging with stakeholders to identify areas of improvement in financial transparency and analysis creating analysis and reporting products as directed by the Chief Financial Officer CFO and other stakeholders to improve transparency and stakeholder engagement and providing an ad hoc analysis as directed by the CFO Mr Johnson will also continue supporting development of the student centered funding formula The amendment will allow Mr Johnson to continue working on and updating models on vendor capacity financial impact and risks associated with developing the COVID testing plan COVID testing plan is one of the key components in the decision making of when to reopen schools and allow students to return to a physical classroom Why do we need to do this now Mr Johnsons experience and depth in knowledge on financial statement and budget analytics have and will continue to provide addedvalue in our efforts to increase transparency and credibility to the public on the Districts financial information and to ensure optimal allocation of resources to the communities of schools of both base and supplementalconcentration funds The work on student centered funding has begun and the District has to meet key deadlines of the grant It is also extremely important for the District to continue the testing work which will enable district leadership in making ongoing decisions about safe reopening of schools What would happen if this were not approved If this were not approved Los Angeles Unified senior leaders parents the community and the public would not be able to benefit from Mr Johnsons expertise during an important critical and challenging time in this financial uncertainty and when the District is faced with scrutiny on presenting financial information The work on development of the student centered funding formula will be impacted The District will also not be able to benefit from Mr Johnsons work on the COVID testing plan Unless we have a solid strategy on testing District students and employees with minimal disruption and cost our students will not be able to return to a physical classroom and be taught face to face by a teacher Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January What are the terms of the proposed agreement This Agreement is being

Austin Beutner Superintendent Members Board of Education FROM Alison YoshimotoTowery Chief Academic Officer Pedro Garcia Senior Executive Director INFORMATIVE DATE January SUBJECT CONTRACTOR NAME CEDARSSINAI HEALTH SYSTEM CONTRACT NO CONTRACT AMOUNT REVENUE REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT Student Impact The CedarsSinai Team Heal program provides injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support to student athletes at schools that are in highneed communities The program will also implement concussion rehabilitation which includes academic assistance and unlimited concussion retesting CedarsSinai will provide neurological clearance to School Nursing Services and athletic departments to make sure LA Unified is compliant with all state and national regulations laws for return to play In addition CedarsSinai will provide monthly reports and data on concussion trends and incidents at all participating school sites CedarsSinai will consult team coaches nurses and athletic directors and make suggestions for best practices for training and game play so as reduce concussion risk and exposure and other athletic injuries This will prevent students from missing school for further medical evaluations Introduction The Team Heal program has been providing comprehensive medical management at five high schools Crenshaw Dorsey Westchester Carson and Banning through a Memorandum of Understanding since July The purpose of the proposed service agreement is to replace the Team Heal Foundation contract that expired on December and continue to receive services through CedarsSinai The Team Heal program provides one of the most comprehensive systems to address brain health in youth The focus is on three primary areas related to core concussion management program prevention reduction through education and treatmentcare of brain injuries If the service agreement is approved the Team Heal program will be able to continue to actively educate coaches athletic directors students and parents on brain injury and safety in play and to perform C Logix concussion testing which provides baseline data of the brains healthy state as a metric to measure against the brain in the event a concussion is experienced This measurement will provide neurological telemedicine sessions Certified Athletic Trainers will continue to make immediate on the field assessments of concussion injuries and then immediately consult with a neurologist for supplemental immediate diagnosis and future treatment A team of doctors on call will continue to assist remotely if an injury is sustained during play Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January Why is this necessary The service agreement is necessary so that under CedarsSinai the Team Heal program can continue to provide the following services for the five schools currently participating in this pilot program injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support The State of California passed Assembly Bill and LA Unified is working to comply with the new legislation by tracking concussions and return to play procedures The Team Heal program at these five schools is designed to gather accurate data so the District can estimate how prone student athletes are to concussions Data from the program will also assist in determining if the services can be made available throughout the District Why do we need to do this now AB was passed January and requires all high schools to document and monitor return to play procedures for concussions in high school athletics Concussions are very difficult to diagnose and District schools with Team Heal program athletic trainers currently have the appropriate personnel to determine baseline data on the number of concussions expected at a school site To ensure District compliance with the legislation the baseline data on frequency of injuries from the five Team Heal program schools will assist school nurses at our five high schools with monitoring return to play procedures and reporting concussions What would happen if this were not approved If the contract were not approved student athletes at these five schools would not receive injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support These students are also tested for concussions receive ongoing testing and rehabilitation for concussions or receive indepth concussion prevention Many concussions would go undiagnosed and many students would not receive the appropriate medical services The District would have a higher rate of exposure to lawsuits due to not diagnosing and monitoring a variety of injuries What are the terms of the proposed agreement The agreement contains language recognizing the assumption and assignment of the Team Heal program from Team Heal foundation Inc to CedarsSinai Health Systems The contract is an eighteenmonth service agreement funded by a grant from CedarsSinai to continue to provide services to the following five high schools Banning Carson Crenshaw Dorsey and Westchester The contract is for maximum revenue of over eighteen months The funds would cover the labor costs of the five athletic trainers inclusive of estimated benefits and related expenses as needed including but not limited to medical supervision supplies and equipment determined by CedarsSinaiTeam Heal If you have any questions or require

Version Amendment to the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to Approve Construction Activities for Three Projects that Address Critical School Repair Needs January Facilities Services Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Board of Education Board approve an amendment to the Facilities Services Division FSD Strategic Execution Plan SEP to authorize and fund construction activities for three projects that address critical school repair needs as listed on Attachment A Staff further proposes that the Board authorize the Chief Procurement Officer andor the Chief Facilities Executive andor their designees to execute all instruments necessary as legally permissible to implement the proposed projects including budget modifications and the purchase of equipment and materials This action amends the previously approved project definition which includes preconstruction activities only and allocates an additional to the projects The total combined budget for the projects is including the previously approved budget of Background On November the Board approved a project definition proposal to address critical school repair needs at Franklin High School Board Report No The proposal requested initial funding in the amount of for preconstruction activities associated with an Auditorium Building seismic retrofit project on campus In addition on March the Board approved a project definition proposal to address critical repair needs at Carnegie Middle School and Castle Heights Elementary School Board Report No The proposal requested initial funding in the amount of and respectively for pre construction activities associated with Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning system projects on campus Preconstruction activities generally include due diligence planning and design activities and may include environmental analysis in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act regulations Staffs proposal now requests construction authority and funding to complete the projects detailed in Attachment A Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board of Education will approve the proposed action to address critical school repair needs that will improve student health safety and educational quality Board Options and Consequences A yes vote will authorize staff to proceed with the expenditure of Bond funds to undertake the proposal in accordance with the provisions set forth in Measures K R Y and Q If the proposed action is not approved bond funds will not be expended to fully implement the projects and critical school repair needs will remain unaddressed Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Policy Implications The action is consistent with the Districts commitment to address unmet school facilities needs and provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment Moreover the proposal is aligned with the Board adopted Facilities Bond Program strategy to address unfunded and pressing school facilities needs related to safety compliance and instructional requirements Board Report No Budget Impact The total combined budget for the three projects is which includes the previously approved combined budget of for preconstruction activities and an increase of for construction activities The projects will be funded with Bond Program funds earmarked specifically for critical school repair and safety improvements to school building components Each project budget was prepared based on the latest available information and assumptions about the project scope site conditions and market conditions Individual project budgets will be reviewed throughout the construction phases as new information becomes known or unforeseen conditions arise and will be adjusted accordingly to enable the successful completion of each project Student Impact Continuing our efforts to undertake critical school repair and safety improvement projects is a vital component to the Districts ability to provide safe school environments that promote teaching and learning Issues and Analysis The projects were previously defined and approved by the Board to include preconstruction activities only Whereas traditionally projects are presented for authorization for both preconstruction and construction activities this alternative approach was used with select projects that require a significant period of design as it allocates less funding at the time of initial approval Having concluded preconstruction activities and identified funding the projects are ready to proceed with construction following Board approval of this action Bond Oversight Committee Recommendations This item was considered by the BOC at its meeting on December Staff has concluded that this proposed FSD SEP amendment will facilitate the implementation of the FSD SEP and therefore it will not adversely affect the Districts ability to

community meeting included an overview of the Project presented the updated Project design anticipated schedule findings of the Preliminary Environmental Assessment PEAE and MND findings Members of the public were provided an opportunity to make comments and ask questions during the public meeting Comments were received from Erik Van Breene and Stephen SarianaLampson DOCUMENT FORMAT This document is organized as follows Section Introduction This section describes CEQA requirements and the content of this document Section Response to Comments This section provides a list of agencies and interested persons commenting on the MND copies of comment letters received during the public review period and individual responses to written comments To facilitate review of the responses each comment letter has been reproduced and assigned a number Individual comments have been numbered in each letter and the letter is followed by responses from LAUSD with references to the corresponding comment number CEQA REQUIREMENTS REGARDING COMMENTS AND RESPONSES CEQA Guidelines Section b outlines parameters for submitting comments on mitigated negative declarations and reminds persons and public agencies that the focus of review and comment of MNDs should be on the proposed findings that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment If the commenter believes that the project may have a significant effect they should Identify the specific effect Explain why they believe the effect would occur and Explain why they believe the effect would be significant Comments are most helpful when they suggest additional specific alternatives or mitigation measures that would provide better ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental effects At the same time reviewers should be aware that the adequacy of a MND is determined in terms of what is reasonably feasible CEQA Guidelines Section c advises [re]viewers should explain the basis for their comments and should submit data or references offering facts reasonable assumptions based on facts or expert opinion supported by facts in support of the comments Pursuant to Section an effect shall not be considered significant in the absence of substantial evidence Section d also states [e]ach responsible agency and trustee agency shall focus its comments on environmental information germane to that agencys statutory responsibility Section e states [t]his section shall not be used to restrict the ability of reviewers to comment on the general adequacy of a document or of the lead agency to reject comments not focused as recommended by this section Finally CEQA does not require a lead agency to conduct every test or perform all research study and experimentation recommended or demanded by commenters Written responses to comments are not required for MNDs however it is LAUSDs policy to respond in writing to all comments When responding to comments lead agencies need only respond to potentially significant environmental issues and do not need to provide all information requested by reviewers as long as a good faith effort at full disclosure is made in the environmental document

D Commenting Person Agency Date of Comment Page Number Miya Edmonson California Department of Transportation October Adrian Scott Fine Los Angeles Conservancy November A Response to Comments from Erik Van Breene from the October Community Meeting A Mr Van Breene indicated that it appears there will be extensive remodeling of interiors of the Administration and Home Economics Buildings This raises concerns over retention of historic character defining features and finishes What reasons exist for moving historic features from their original location to other buildings ie Benches in Administration to Home Economics Building Furniture and artwork are not considered characteristic of the historic buildings at Lincoln HS In addition the building interiors at Lincoln have been significantly modified over the years However the District still recognizes the importance of these items to the greater school community These items will be stored and reinstalled in their original locations whenever possible although a few items will be relocated because of changing spaces and dimensions postproject As evaluated the space with the most interior character is the Auditorium where most of the features are being retained or in some cases enhanced LAUSD will also implement several LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval that will ensure compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties and LAUSD Guidelines and Treatment Approaches for Historic Schools that address the commenters concerns about historic character defining features Specifically SCCUL SCCUL and SCCUL as outlined in section V Cultural Resources of the IS A In RINCON historic resources assessment Building Music Building and Buildings and Classroom buildings were identified as contributors to the Blowout historic district on campus These were not included in the HRG assessment Under the proposed plan Building will be demolished because of critical conditions what are these conditions LAUSD proposes to complete the proposed Project in an effort to provide facilities that are safe secure and aligned with the instructional program per section Project Description of the IS Assessments of the buildings on campus are used during the Districts planning and design process to define the scope of the proposed Project It was during this process that Building Music Building was identified as having poor mechanical electricallighting plumbing data systems and not meeting meet the current code for fire life safety The Historic Resource Assessment Report for Lincoln High School was a preliminary review of the campus It identified Buildings and as potential contributors to the Historic District because they were in existence at the time of the Blowouts However Historic Resources Group HRG researched how buildings and places associated with civil rights related historic events are identified They found that buildings that provided a backdrop to these events are the ones identified as significantly associated In the case of Lincoln and the blowouts the front lawn and buildings that frame ie the Administration Building and Auditorium Building were identified as the backdrop of the blowouts Students gathered in the lawn area and marched in front of the school along N Broadway during the historic event The contributing buildings identified by HRG served as the backdrop in much of the media images produced at the time documenting the event The other buildings are located behind the Administration Building and were not visible Therefore they do not contribute to the civil rights event that gives this campus historic significance B Response to Comments from Stephen SarianaLampson from the October Community Meeting B Mr SarianaLampson asked why were only shallow borings initially taken on the east campus site and athletic field when it sits on an earthquake fault and there have been documented slippages above the tennis courts A geotechnical report was completed for this Project and borings were taken based upon the known scope of the Project at the time the report was completed As noted in section VII Geology and Soils of the ISMND according to the Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation Lincoln High School the closest known active fault to the site with evidence of surface rupture is the Raymond Fault which is located approximately miles north of the site As further noted in the ISMND review of regional faults did not identify any known active or potentially active faults that have been recognized as crossing or projecting toward the Lincoln HS site However should the scope of the Project is updated to include development within an expanded area additional borings will be completed at that time Additionally all development will comply with the District California Geological Survey CGS and Department of State Architect DSA guidelines and standards to ensure the safety and security of each development C Response to Comments from Miya Edmonson California Department of Transportation October C C C Caltrans thanked the LAUSD for including them in the environmental review process for the proposed Project provided a general summary of the Project description indicated the location of State facilities within proximity to the Project site and concurred with the MND finding that Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary The Commenter suggests various Transportation Demand Management TDM strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled VMT and Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions for LAUSDs consideration No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the MND were raised therefore no further response is necessary LAUSD acknowledges that any transportation of heavy construction equipment andor materials which requires use of oversizedtransport vehicles on State highways will need a Caltrans transportation permit that large size truck trips should be limited to offpeak commute periods and that a Construction Traffic Worksite Traffic Control Plan would be needed if construction traffic would cause delays on State facilities No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary D Response to Comments from Adrian Scott Fine Los Angeles Conservancy November D Mr Fine Director of Advocacy at the Los Angeles Conservancy thanked LAUSD for providing the opportunity to comment on the ISMND provided a general summary of the historic nature of the campus and appreciated LAUSDs sensitivity and preservation minded approach to the rehabilitation and modernization of the Lincoln HS Campus No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary D The Commenter expressed potential concerns regarding proposed interior modifications and would like more details of proposed changes Furniture and artwork are not considered characteristic of the historic buildings at Lincoln HS In addition the building interiors at Lincoln have been significantly modified over the years That said the District still recognizes the importance of these items to the greater school community As previously noted in response A these items will be stored and reinstalled in their original locations whenever possible although a few items will need to be relocated because of changing spaces and dimensions postProject The space with the most interior character is the Auditorium where most of the features are being retained or in some cases even enhanced Furthermore as noted on MND page throughout the proposed Project LAUSD shall implement processes and professionals who meet the Secretary of the

the resources SC CUL As concluded in the IS with implementation of cultural SCs SCCUL through SCCUL project impact would be less than significant D Commenter indicates limited analysis in the initial study would like to know why the HRG study cited possible adverse changes to district contributors and strongly recommends an expansion of the analysis to identify historicdefining interior spaces features and finishes of contributing buildings to plan for retention and preservation of historic buildings and features The ISMND incorporates the information provided in the HRG study Based on the information available LAUSD assumes the HRG study cited possible adverse changes would result from any changes made to the interior or exterior of district contributing buildings if the changes were not consistent with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties because this language is the standard by which historic evaluations are completed under CEQA As previously noted the compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards is a required component of the Project as documented by the Project as defined and as evaluated with SCs SCCUL SCCUL and SCCUL through SCCUL The HRG study included a list of exterior character defining features for contributing buildings within the district and included as an attachment to the study a memorandum from Rincon Consultants Inc sent to LAUSD in prior to the completion of the HRG study This memorandum includes a brief list of some of the interior historicdefining spaces for four of the contributing buildings to the historic district The entire HRG report including the memorandum will be used in the planning and retention of historic buildings and features No further expansion of the HRG study is currently proposed However SCCUL and SC CUL will address the commenters concerns related to historicdefining interior spaces features and finishes of contributing buildings The Secretary of the Interiors Qualified Historic Architect retained under SCCUL shall provide input throughout the design process to ensure compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and LAUSD requirements and guidelines for the treatment of historical resources D Commenter indicates that Lincoln HS campus represents a limited and increasing diminishing resource type and is characteristic of the PWA Moderne style The Conservancy greatly appreciates LAUSDs preservation approach However the Conservancy has concerns about the potential loss of character defining interior features and suggests further study LAUSD will take all the written comments received under consideration The commenter provided a summary conclusion of their comment letter and

Project Design Features Project design features PDFs are environmental protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and SCs there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs LAUSD is the responsible party for compliance with all measures related to the proposed Project Specifically LAUSD is responsible for compliance with and implementation of all of the mitigation measures that are outlined in this MMRP and stated in the associated ISMND for the proposed Project PROJECT LOCATION The approximately acre Campus spans across two parcels and is separated by Lincoln Park Avenue The

Plan Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Guidelines and to permit construction activities to commence at a later date staff is requesting the Board approve the proposed Project The proposed action may only be considered after the Board adopts the MND prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project Board Report No Background The proposed Project is located on an acre site at North Broadway in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles and within the boundaries of the Lincoln HeightsEl Sereno Community of Schools Local District East and Board District Mnica Garca As of the Electronic Capacity Assessment Review Lincoln High School served students in ninth through twelfth grade The Board approved the project definition for the proposed Project on December Board Report No The proposed Project consists of the construction of new school buildings the modernization and improvements to existing school facilities and the demolition of certain aging and deteriorated buildings The Project scope also includes interim facilities as necessary to accommodate the displacement of facilities and its associated functions during construction The proposed Project includes the construction of approximately general and specialty classrooms and associated support spaces within a new classroom building and a Performing Arts Building a Maintenance and Operations Building two concession stands and a field house restroom building In addition the proposed Project includes the voluntary seismic retrofit and modernization of Administration Building Home Economics Building Auditorium Building Gymnasium Building and Pedestrian Bridge Improvements to meet programmatic access requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA will be made throughout the school site including to buildings The exterior of all existing buildings on campus will be painted as necessary to provide a uniform appearance and enhanced curb appeal and existing classrooms not being modernized will receive minor interior improvements to help promote teaching and learning Aging and Los Angeles Unified School District Page

Internet Protocol convergence systems CCTV and other systems serving the site will also be upgraded as required Various safety conditions will be improved including site lighting fencing and gates as needed Landscape and hardscape improvements will also be made including construction of a new parking area plaza horticulture garden a batting cage visitor bleachers the removal and replacement of trees and paving improvements throughout the site The proposed Project also includes the demolition of Shop Building Music Building Storage Building and ten relocatable buildings Building s including three buildings utilized by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School Four relocatable buildings consisting of three classrooms and one adminparent center space will be upgraded and installed for use by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School and associated fencing and utility infrastructure improvements will be undertaken Based on a review and assessment of classroom utilization enrollment and demographic and enrollment projections the proposed Project is planned for an enrollment of students This will result in a reduction of classrooms of which are located in aging relocatable buildings Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt staffs proposal which will permit construction activities to be undertaken at a later date once Division of the State Architect DSA approval is secured Staff anticipates that construction activities related to the construction of the new buildings and modernization of existing facilities will begin in the first quarter of and that siteutilityinterim housing activities may begin in advance of this work in an earlier phase Construction is anticipated to be completed by the fourth quarter of and will occur in multiple phases Board Options and Consequences Adoption of staffs proposal will permit Los Angeles Unified to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured If the proposed action is not adopted staff will be unable to proceed with construction activities As a result Lincoln High School will continue to operate with aging deteriorating and outdated buildings and grounds Furthermore students staff and the community will not benefit from the significant facilities improvements that will be undertaken as part of the proposed Project Policy Implications The proposal supports the implementation of the proposed Project which the Board approved a project definition for on December Board Report No The proposed action is consistent with the longterm goal to address unmet school facilities needs and significantly improve conditions of aging and deteriorating school facilities as described in local bond measures Budget Impact The proposed action does not have a budget impact The Board previously authorized funding for the proposed Project when it adopted the Project definition Board Report No As design and project development have progressed the scope is further refined and the budget modified The current budget for the proposed Project Project No is a increase from the last reported budget in The proposed Project is funded by Bond Program funds targeted in the School Upgrade Program for major renovations modernizations andor reconfigurations to school buildings Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Student Impact The proposed Project upon completion will help ensure that the students attending Lincoln High School are provided with a safe and healthy environment and updated facilities that promote learning Issues and Analysis Environmental OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines This evaluation as documented in the Initial Study IS resulted in the preparation of an MND The MND was circulated for a day public review period from October to November The analysis documented in the ISMND found that the proposed Project would not result in significant and unavoidable impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction the Board must adopt the MND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project Project Development The design and development of the proposed Project continues to progress Various preconstruction planning and design activities have been completed This includes community and stakeholder engagement a review of changes in current and projected enrollment which informed additional design and scope decisions to be made The proposed Project scope has been modified to include the following updates classrooms as opposed to the previously anticipated nine classrooms will be constructed in new buildings The reconfiguration and structural upgrades to the Administration Building and Home Economics Building are anticipated to yield one less classroom than previously anticipated in renovated spaces The kitchen and scramble service areas within the Home Economics Building will be renovated and upgraded to address code compliant issues associated with food distribution and preparation The existing lunch shelter will be upgraded with a new fire alarm and fire sprinkler system that comply with code requirements associated with the path of travel between the Home Economics Building and the lunch shelter The athletic field areas require restroom and concession facilities to safely accommodate athletic events and use of the fields A new restroom building and homevisitor concession stands will be constructed and the gymnasium renovations will include expanded restrooms to support the fields The existing batting cages and associated site infrastructure required for the restrooms and concessions will be demolished replaced andor relocated as necessary The logistical challenges to construct the proposed Project while keeping the school operational during construction require multiple phases of construction the placement of interim housing onsite and now the removal and replacement of existing aging and deteriorating relocatable buildings utilized by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School During construction of the proposed Project the Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School Program will be temporarily relocated to existing available classroom space at Glen Alta Elementary School The temporary relocation will allow for necessary construction activities to support the Project

School Districts LAUSDs CEQA required mitigation measures identified in the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Administrative MediaLiteracy Kitchen Building Project Mitigated Negative Declaration MND State Clearinghouse No This MMRP has been prepared in conformance with Section of the Public Resources Code and LAUSD practice Section states a When making findings required by paragraph of subdivision a of Section or when adopting a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to paragraph of subdivision c of Section the following requirements shall apply The public agency shall adopt a reporting or monitoring program for the changes made to the project or conditions of project approval adopted in order to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment The reporting or monitoring program shall be designed to ensure compliance during project implementation For those changes which have been required or incorporated into the project at the request of a responsible agency or a public agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by the project that agency shall if so requested by the lead or responsible agency prepare and submit a proposed reporting or monitoring program The charter school Project is subject to the California Department of Education CDE design and siting requirements and the school architectural designs are subject to review and approval by the California Division of the State Architect DSA The proposed Project is required to comply with specific design standards and sustainable building practices Certain standards assist in reducing environmental impacts such as the California Green Building Code CALGreen Code LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval SC and the Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools CHPS criteria California Green Building Code Part of the California Building Standards Code is the California Green Building Standards Code also known as the CALGreen Code The CALGreen Code is a statewide green building standards code and is applicable to residential and nonresidential buildings throughout California California Green Building Standards Code Title Part Program EIR for the School Upgrade

new school and modernization project in the District from the beginning of the design process incorporate CHPS Collaborative for High Performance Schools criteria to the extent possible including schools The CALGreen Code was developed to reduce GHG from buildings promote environmentally responsible costeffective healthier places to live and work reduce energy and water consumption and respond to the environmental directives of the Department of Housing and Community Development Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects SCs were adopted by the BOE on February Board Report Number SCs are environmental standards that are applied to District construction upgrade and improvement projects during the environmental review process by the OEHS California Environmental Quality Act CEQA team to offset potential environmental impacts The SCs were largely compiled from established LAUSD standards guidelines specifications practices plans policies and programs For each SC applicability is triggered by factors such as the project type and existing conditions These SCs are implemented during the planning construction and operational phases of the projects The Board of Education adopted a previous version of the SCs on November Board Report Number They were originally compiled as a supplement to the Program Environmental Impact Report Program EIR for the School Upgrade Program which was certified by the BOE on November also Board Report No The most recently adopted SCs were updated in order to incorporate and reflect recent changes in the laws regulations and the Districts standard policies practices and specifications eg the Design Guidelines and Design Standards which are routinely updated and are referenced throughout the Standard Conditions Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools The proposed Project would include CHPS criteria points under seven categories Integration Indoor Environmental Quality Energy Water Site Materials and Waste Management and Operations and Metrics LAUSD is committed to sustainable construction principles and has been a member of the CHPS since CHPS has established criteria for the development of high performance schools to create a better educational experience for students and teachers by designing the best facilities possible CHPSdesigned facilities are healthy comfortable energy efficient material efficient easy to maintain and operate commissioned environmentally responsive site a building that teaches safe and secure community resource stimulating architecture and adaptable to changing needs The proposed Project would comply with CHPS and LAUSD sustainability guidelines The design team would be responsible for incorporating sustainability features for the proposed Project including onsite treatment of stormwater runoff cool roof building materials lighting that reduces light pollution water and energyefficient design water wise landscaping collection of recyclables and sustainable andor recycledcontent building materials Project Design Features Project design features PDFs are environmental protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and SCs there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is the project proponent and developer of this Project and as such has assumed all of the responsibilities that would typically be attributed to LAUSD Where Standard Conditions of Approval or other measures identify LAUSD as the responsible party it is understood that Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is in fact the responsible party for compliance with these and all measures related to the proposed Project Specifically Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is responsible for compliance with and implementation of all of the measures that are outlined in this MND for the proposed Project PROJECT LOCATION The Project

section provides a list of agencies organizations and interested persons that commented on the MND comment letters received during the public review period and individual responses to written comments To facilitate review of the responses each comment letter has been reproduced and assigned a letter Individual comments in each letter are numbered and each letter is followed by responses with reference to the corresponding comment number CEQA REQUIREMENTS REGARDING COMMENTS AND RESPONSES CEQA Guidelines Section b outlines parameters for submitting comments on MNDs and reminds persons and public agencies that the focus of review and comment should be on the proposed finding that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment If the commenter believes that the project may have a significant effect it should Identify the specific effect Explain why they believe the effect would occur and Explain why they believe the effect would be significant Comments are most helpful when they suggest additional specific alternatives or mitigation measures that would provide better ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental effects At the same time reviewers should be aware that the adequacy of an MND is determined in terms of what is reasonably feasible Section d also states Each responsible agency and trustee agency shall focus its comments on environmental information germane to that agencys statutory responsibility Section e states This section shall not be used to restrict the ability of reviewers to comment on the general adequacy of a document or of the lead agency to reject comments not focused as recommended by this section Finally CEQA does not require a lead agency to conduct every test or perform all research study and experimentation recommended or demanded by commenters Written responses to comments are not required for MNDs however it is LAUSDs policy to respond in writing to all comments When responding to comments lead agencies need only respond to potentially significant environmental issues and do not need to provide all information requested by reviewers as long as a good faith effort at full disclosure is made in the environmental document This page intentionally left blank Response to Comments This section has the written comments received on the circulated MND and LAUSDs response to

Project Vaughn will be able to accommodate the enrollment growth in accordance with its approved charter petition The Project will continue to provide a long term location for Vaughn who has waived its rights under Proposition for the term its current SOA Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt staffs proposal which will permit construction activities to be undertaken by Vaughn at a later date once DSA approval is secured Board Options and Consequences Adoption of staffs proposal will permit Vaughn to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured which is needed to provide adequate classroom space to accommodate Vaughns planned enrollment growth of students If the proposed action is not adopted Vaughn will not have

The region continues to experience construction price cost escalation Determining the most appropriate budget assumptions for the proposed Project is challenging at this time since the design is incomplete DSA approval has not been secured and the volatile nature of the market If Vaughns estimated cost for the DSA approved design andor receipt of bids results in an increase in their Project budget and a request for an increase to the augmentation grant awarded by Los Angeles Unified staff will return to the Board to request authorization for the requested increase Los Angeles Unified

The analysis documented in the ISMND found that the Project would not result in significant and unavoidable environmental impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction the Board must adopt the MND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project Project Development The design and development of the proposed Project continues to progress Vaughn has completed various pre construction planning activities including community and stakeholder engagement Vaughn has worked with Facilities staff to ensure the proposed Project meets Los Angeles Unifieds standards and specifications The proposed Project will now include additional work required by the Los Angeles

Human Resources Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Human Resources Divisions request for two teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit be approved pursuant to Title California Code of Regulations Section Background The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed During the first year of employment the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit Attachment A Additionally the CTC requires that the approval of these Permits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the consent agenda Expected Outcomes The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential Board Options and Consequences Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved and a fulltime teacher cannot be hired classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency Day Substitute Teaching Permits Daytoday substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Policy Implications This action does not change District policy Budget Impact There is no impact on the Districts budget Student Impact The goal of the Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom In areas of

students are currently earning D and F grades during distance learning Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District has been directed by the California Department of Education to take corrective

near the bottom nationally in perpupil funding with students in Los Angeles receiving approximately half as much money per student as those in New York City Whereas The states underfunding of public

following resolution as amended was referred to the Curriculum and Instruction Committee Ms Goldberg Ensuring Support for Students at All Los Angeles Unified School District Schools Res Noticed September Whereas The value of a public school cannot be quantified in a single summative rating which can shame penalize or stigmatize schools education professionals students and entire communities Whereas School ratings promote unhealthy competition between schools exacerbate community antagonisms by producing artificial winners and losers and penalize schools that serve socioeconomically disadvantaged student populations Whereas It is wellunderstood that the academic achievement gap continues to be perpetuated by socioeconomic and socioemotional factors Whereas School ranking systems that prioritize student performance on standardized tests fail to adequately take into account socioeconomic and socioemotional factors that influence school needs and are reflected in the academic achievement levels of students Whereas Research indicates that online school performance achievement ratings exacerbate economic and social segregation in the United States accelerating divergences in housing values income distributions education levels and the racial and ethnic composition of communities Whereas On April the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District adopted Achieving Excellence for All Establishing a Framework for Continuous Improvement Res which called for the development of a School Performance Framework SPF that would enable the District to identify and track the overall performance of each school annually and evaluate all schools with a uniform set of measures Whereas The proposed SPF presented to the Board on November heavily relies on ValueAdded Growth modeling a technique subject to variability and error which is therefore inappropriate for highstakes evaluations resulting in rankings categorization or absolute comparisons Whereas The proposed SPF seeks included the requirement to distill the natural and inherent complexity of a school community into a single summative rating Whereas Identifying schools and students meeting or not meeting proficiency level benchmarks to inform the provision of support and resources is a task already conducted by District administrators principals and teachers on an almost daily basis and Whereas Rather than having to implement a summative school ranking system the Superintendent and Local District Superintendents should be permitted to focus on continuous improvement using multiple measures such as student growth responsible reclassification and school climate to addressing the academic achievement gap experienced by students from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities lacking financial political and social capital now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District suspend implementation of the SPF and any launching or utilization of the SPFincluding any use of stars scores or any other rating systemin or on any District platforms until a more indepth analysis of the SPFs metrics is conducted by the

neighborhoods Resolved further That the District further the goal of giving students parents school employees and the general public more information about District schools by including important and wide ranging types of data from the California Department of Educations California School Dashboard on its website in an accessible fashion Resolved further That the District will provide parents with a guide and workshops on how to utilize the California School Dashboard Resolved further That the District collaborate with the California Department of Education to improve the California School Dashboard based on school community and parent feedback Resolved further That Local District personnel work closely with the administrators and teachers of schools with large numbers of students experiencing difficulties meeting or exceeding state standards to help increase the number of students meeting and exceeding state standards at these schools and be it finally Resolved further The funds designated to implement the SPF be equitably distributed according to need between i Local Area Districts tasked with identifying schools that serve high concentrations of highneeds students experiencing difficulty performing academically and ii supports that can be provided to increase academic performance among those students and be it finally Resolved That the schools both District and

Financial Officer TO Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent FROM V Luis Buendia Deputy Chief Financial Officer SUBJECT CONTRACTOR NAME Erik Johnson CONTRACT NO CONTRACT AMOUNT REQUEST TO AMEND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT Student Impact The work on budget transparency is supporting the community of schools by designing the Districts budget and financial statements to support the new District structure Making the budget easier to understand will allow school administrators to focus on student outcomes The development of student centered funding formula will increase the support provided to our high needs students In addition the work done on COVID testing plan will make it safer for students to return to a physical classroom Introduction Many concerns have been raised about the complexity in understanding the Districts budget and financial statements These concerns need to be addressed and we are therefore tasked to produce simple to understand budgets and financial statements for senior leaders management parents school communities and the public Mr Johnson is helping in providing a mapping to convert the complex financial data into what is simple and easy to understand He has been working on developing a roadmap of financial reporting requirements determining areas of improvements and advising on the Districts open data portal The portal includes a dashboard for stakeholders to explore District and schoollevel budget and expenditure data Now that school operations are being decentralized to the communities of schools where the support for schools is aimed at being in the core of the community it is imperative that financial information is simple in order that schools make the right decisions in allocating resources to ensure equity and maximize the benefit to their students and to support District goals Mr Johnson coordinated preparation of the Districts application for the USDEs New Grants Under the WellRounded Education through StudentCentered Funding Demonstration Grants Program CFDA E The purpose of the program is to provide competitive grants to LEAs to demonstrate model programs for providing wellrounded education opportunities through the development and implementation of studentcentered funding systems based on weighted perpupil allocations under section of the ESEA Elementary and Secondary Education Act Mr Johnson will assist in developing the studentcentered funding system Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January One of Mr Johnsons important role is his involvement in the overall strategy on preparing and messaging across all aspects of the Districts COVID testing program This work included a model to determine per day testing capacity by vendor used to determine the testing plan for re opening schools Scenario modeling and projections on implementing a districtwide COVID testing program has also been developed to enable district leadership to understand tradeoffs and pressures on district and vendor capacity Financial impacts on models of multiple testing scenarios including third party costs and internal LAUSD costs of testing program has been valuable in the decision making process Mr Johnson has provided documentation on dataflow and system architecture and contributed in identifying and developing plans to mitigate risk and issues which is a key component of the planning process Mr Johnson has been coordinating interaction with Medical University partners including UCLA Stanford and Johns Hopkins University and Anthem Healthcare Why is this necessary This amendment will extend the contract to continue the work on improved new reporting and analysis process and outputs of LAUSDs finances The work includes assessment of the current state of financial planning and analysis team capacity and work products engaging with stakeholders to identify areas of improvement in financial transparency and analysis creating analysis and reporting products as directed by the Chief Financial Officer CFO and other stakeholders to improve transparency and stakeholder engagement and providing an ad hoc analysis as directed by the CFO Mr Johnson will also continue supporting development of the student centered funding formula The amendment will allow Mr Johnson to continue working on and updating models on vendor capacity financial impact and risks associated with developing the COVID testing plan COVID testing plan is one of the key components in the decision making of when to reopen schools and allow students to return to a physical classroom Why do we need to do this now Mr Johnsons experience and depth in knowledge on financial statement and budget analytics have and will continue to provide addedvalue in our efforts to increase transparency and credibility to the public on the Districts financial information and to ensure optimal allocation of resources to the communities of schools of both base and supplementalconcentration funds The work on student centered funding has begun and the District has to meet key deadlines of the grant It is also extremely important for the District to continue the testing work which will enable district leadership in making ongoing decisions about safe reopening of schools What would happen if this were not approved If this were not approved Los Angeles Unified senior leaders parents the community and the public would not be able to benefit from Mr Johnsons expertise during an important critical and challenging time in this financial uncertainty and when the District is faced with scrutiny on presenting financial information The work on development of the student centered funding formula will be impacted The District will also not be able to benefit from Mr Johnsons work on the COVID testing plan Unless we have a solid strategy on testing District students and employees with minimal disruption and cost our students will not be able to return to a

Insurance Services requests Board approval to establish a short term oneyear contract that will carry forward the terms and conditions of Contract with Sedgwick Sedgwick provides workers compensation claims administration services for the District The current contract with Sedgwick expires on January This is a request to bridge the period of the agreement extending the end date to January for the sixth year and to add to the annual contract the amount of Sedgwick was first selected through a competitive process to provide claims administration services in Since that time Sedgwick successfully competed to continue to provide claims administration services Recent achievements during Sedgwicks management of the Districts workers compensation claims include a million decrease in the cost of workers compensation benefits from the fiscal year to implementation of direct deposit for injured workers and a rapid response to the states recently imposed COVID reporting requirements Why is this necessary The state mandates that all employers carry workers compensation coverage to protect Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January employees injured at work The District provides its coverage through selfinsurance and requires a licensed thirdparty administrator with certified staff to manage the claims Sedgwick determines an employees eligibility for workers compensation benefits which include medical care and wage replacement The District will issue in the oneyear period a Request for Proposal that will reflect the best current practices and billing models being employed by other agencies Extending for the sixth year is in the best interest of the District and injured employees to ensure continuity of medical and claims services and to minimize the impact of the COVID pandemic on employees injured at work Why do we need to do this now The current contract expires on January What would happen if this were not approved If this is not approved the District will not comply with the state mandate to provide workers compensation coverage District employees will be left without mandated workers compensation benefits and medical and other service providers will not be compensated for their services What are the terms of the proposed agreement A oneyear short term contract incorporating the terms and conditions of the expiring contract

CEDARSSINAI HEALTH SYSTEM CONTRACT NO CONTRACT AMOUNT REVENUE REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACT Student Impact The CedarsSinai Team Heal program provides injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support to student athletes at schools that are in highneed communities The program will also implement concussion rehabilitation which includes academic assistance and unlimited concussion retesting CedarsSinai will provide neurological clearance to School Nursing Services and athletic departments to make sure LA Unified is compliant with all state and national regulations laws for return to play In addition CedarsSinai will provide monthly reports and data on concussion trends and incidents at all participating school sites CedarsSinai will consult team coaches nurses and athletic directors and make suggestions for best practices for training and game play so as reduce concussion risk and exposure and other athletic injuries This will prevent students from missing school for further medical evaluations Introduction The Team Heal program has been providing comprehensive medical management at five high schools Crenshaw Dorsey Westchester Carson and Banning through a Memorandum of Understanding since July The purpose of the proposed service agreement is to replace the Team Heal Foundation contract that expired on December and continue to receive services through CedarsSinai The Team Heal program provides one of the most comprehensive systems to address brain health in youth The focus is on three primary areas related to core concussion management program prevention reduction through education and treatmentcare of brain injuries If the service agreement is approved the Team Heal program will be able to continue to actively educate coaches athletic directors students and parents on brain injury and safety in play and to perform C Logix concussion testing which provides baseline data of the brains healthy state as a metric to measure against the brain in the event a concussion is experienced This measurement will provide neurological telemedicine sessions Certified Athletic Trainers will continue to make immediate on the field assessments of concussion injuries and then immediately consult with a neurologist for supplemental immediate diagnosis and future treatment A team of doctors on call will continue to assist remotely if an injury is sustained during play Members Board of Education Austin Beutner Superintendent January Why is this necessary The service agreement is necessary so that under CedarsSinai the Team Heal program can continue to provide the following services for the five schools currently participating in this pilot program injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support The State of California passed Assembly Bill and LA Unified is working to comply with the new legislation by tracking concussions and return to play procedures The Team Heal program at these five schools is designed to gather accurate data so the District can estimate how prone student athletes are to concussions Data from the program will also assist in determining if the services can be made available throughout the District Why do we need to do this now AB was passed January and requires all high schools to document and monitor return to play procedures for concussions in high school athletics Concussions are very difficult to diagnose and District schools with Team Heal program athletic trainers currently have the appropriate personnel to determine baseline data on the number of concussions expected at a school site To ensure District compliance with the legislation the baseline data on frequency of injuries from the five Team Heal program schools will assist school nurses at our five high schools with monitoring return to play procedures and reporting concussions What would happen if this were not approved If the contract were not approved student athletes at these five schools would not receive injury prevention medical care athletic training healthcare awareness and mentoring and academic support These students are also tested for concussions receive ongoing testing and rehabilitation for concussions or receive indepth concussion prevention Many concussions would go undiagnosed and many students would not receive the appropriate medical services The District would have a higher rate of exposure to lawsuits due to not diagnosing and monitoring a variety of injuries What are the terms of the proposed agreement The agreement contains language recognizing the assumption and assignment of the Team Heal program from Team Heal foundation Inc to CedarsSinai Health Systems The contract is an eighteenmonth service agreement funded by a grant from CedarsSinai to continue to provide services to the following five high schools Banning Carson Crenshaw Dorsey and Westchester The contract is for maximum revenue of over eighteen months The funds would cover the labor costs of the five athletic trainers inclusive of

emissions on the use of alternative fuel versus diesel fuel Why do we need to do this now The current Propane Gas and Refueling Stations contract expired on September The District needs to have a new

food choices and to encourage community involvement in the School Joint Use Project Los Angeles Unified installed the irrigation system provided EACGC use of the southwest corner of the School Garden so EACGC may design construct maintain and operate the Garden in collaboration with the School under a Joint Use Agreement JUA Between through EACGC has designed developed and constructed various improvements which included weeding plants adding walkways and raised plant beds and planting trees in the Garden by way of community service days under several Los Angeles Unifieds Beautification Agreements On July EACGC entered into a JUA for a term of five years with Los Angeles Unified for the operation and maintenance of the Garden including assigning plots by way of a lottery system and providing access to the community for use of designated plots within the Garden during after school hours and on weekends As part of the JUA EACGC committed to making additional new improvements to the Garden which will include installing an Americans with Disabilities Act ADA compliant pedestrian entrance ramp handrails gate and signage at the entrance of the Garden from the public right of way installing decomposed granite walkways the addition of gardening plots and any path of travel improvements as required Project EACGC was unable to construct the Project due to insufficient funding Through recent fundraising efforts and in partnership with the Westchester Rotary Club EACGC now has sufficient funds and has submitted a request to construct the Project The Project will be

for use by the Office of Government Relations OGR The lease agreement includes an initial term of five years and three months months total and will also provide Los Angeles Unified School District Los Angeles Unified with one option to extend the lease for an additional five years The average monthly rent over the initial fiveyear term is Background OGR formerly occupied offices at K Street Suite Sacramento consisting of approximately square feet The lease expired on September however OGR was able to continue to occupy the space on a monthtomonth basis until September when OGR was required to move out The building will be undergoing substantial renovations and the landlord is not willing to enter into a new lease at this time OGR leased space in this building since though in a larger suite until As a result of a competitive bid process Los Angeles Unified staff engaged the services of Gallaway Commercial Inc Gallaway to represent Los Angeles Unified in the search for a new office location in Sacramento near the State Capitol Gallaway completed a market survey which led to the identification of the office space at K Street Suite consisting of approximately rentable square feet Negotiations initiated between CDA Rotunda Partners LLC the owner of the building and Los Angeles Unified including representatives from Gallaway The proposed lease will have a term of months with one option to extend the term for an additional five years The landlord shall provide a minimum of three consecutive months rental abatement at the start of the lease term The monthly base rent in the first year of the term will be on a full service gross basis and will be subject to an annual fixed increase of approximately After the first year Los Angeles Unified will also be responsible for its

comment number CEQA REQUIREMENTS REGARDING COMMENTS AND RESPONSES CEQA Guidelines Section b outlines parameters for submitting comments on mitigated negative declarations and reminds persons and public agencies that the focus of review and comment of MNDs should be on the proposed findings that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment If the commenter believes that the project may have a significant effect they should Identify the specific effect Explain why they believe the effect would occur and Explain why they believe the effect would be significant Comments are most helpful when they suggest additional specific alternatives or mitigation measures that would provide better ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental effects At the same time reviewers should be aware that the adequacy of a MND is determined in terms of what is reasonably feasible CEQA Guidelines Section c advises [re]viewers should explain the basis for their comments and should submit data or references offering facts reasonable assumptions based on facts or expert opinion supported by facts in support of the comments Pursuant to Section an effect shall not be considered significant in the absence of substantial evidence Section d also states [e]ach responsible agency and trustee agency shall focus its comments on environmental information germane to that agencys statutory responsibility Section e states [t]his section shall not be used to restrict the ability of reviewers to comment on the general adequacy of a document or of the lead agency to reject comments not focused as recommended by this section Finally CEQA does not require a lead agency to conduct every test or perform all research study and experimentation recommended or demanded by commenters Written responses to comments are not required for MNDs however it is LAUSDs policy to respond in writing to all comments When responding to comments lead agencies need only respond to potentially significant environmental issues and do not need to provide all information requested by reviewers as long as a good faith effort at full disclosure is made in the environmental document

Van Breene from the October Community Meeting A Mr Van Breene indicated that it appears there will be extensive remodeling of interiors of the Administration and Home Economics Buildings This raises concerns over retention of historic character defining features and finishes What reasons exist for moving historic features from their original location to other buildings ie Benches in Administration to Home Economics Building Furniture and artwork are not considered characteristic of the historic buildings at Lincoln HS In addition the building interiors at Lincoln have been significantly modified over the years However the District still recognizes the importance of these items to the greater school community These items will be stored and reinstalled in their original locations whenever possible although a few items will be relocated because of changing spaces and dimensions postproject As evaluated the space with the most interior character is the Auditorium where most of the features are being retained or in some cases enhanced LAUSD will also implement several LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval that will ensure compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties and LAUSD Guidelines and Treatment Approaches for Historic Schools that address the commenters concerns about historic character defining features Specifically SCCUL SCCUL and SCCUL as outlined in section V Cultural Resources of the IS A In RINCON historic resources assessment Building Music Building and Buildings and Classroom buildings were identified as contributors to the Blowout historic district on campus These were not included in the HRG assessment Under the proposed plan Building will be demolished because of critical conditions what are these conditions LAUSD proposes to complete the proposed Project in an effort to provide facilities that are safe secure and aligned with the instructional program per section Project Description of the IS Assessments of the buildings on campus are used during the Districts planning and design process to define the scope of the proposed Project It was during this process that Building Music Building was identified as having poor mechanical electricallighting plumbing data systems and not meeting meet the current code for fire life safety The Historic Resource Assessment Report for Lincoln High School was a preliminary review of the campus It identified Buildings and as potential contributors to the Historic District because they were in existence at the time of the Blowouts However Historic Resources Group HRG researched how buildings and places associated with civil rights related historic events are identified They found that buildings that provided a backdrop to these events are the ones identified as significantly associated In the case of Lincoln and the blowouts the front lawn and buildings that frame ie the Administration Building and Auditorium Building were identified as the backdrop of the blowouts Students gathered in the lawn area and marched in front of the school along N Broadway during the historic event The contributing buildings identified by HRG served as the backdrop in much of the media images produced at the time documenting the event The other buildings are located behind the Administration Building and were not visible Therefore they do not contribute to the civil rights event that gives this campus historic significance B Response to Comments from Stephen SarianaLampson from the October Community Meeting B Mr SarianaLampson asked why were only shallow borings initially taken on the east campus site and athletic field when it sits on an earthquake fault and there have been documented slippages above the tennis courts A geotechnical report was completed for this Project and borings were taken based upon the known scope of the Project at the time the report was completed As noted in section VII Geology and Soils of the ISMND according to the Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation Lincoln High School the closest known active fault to the site with evidence of surface rupture is the Raymond Fault which is located approximately miles north of the site As further noted in the ISMND review of regional faults did not identify any known active or potentially active faults that have been recognized as crossing or projecting toward the Lincoln HS site However should the scope of the Project is updated to include development within an expanded area additional borings will be completed at that time Additionally all development will comply with the District California Geological Survey CGS and Department of State Architect DSA guidelines and standards to ensure the safety and security of each development C Response to Comments from Miya Edmonson California Department of Transportation October C C C Caltrans thanked the LAUSD for including them in the environmental review process for the proposed Project provided a general summary of the Project description indicated the location of State facilities within proximity to the Project site and concurred with the MND finding that Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary The Commenter suggests various Transportation Demand Management TDM strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled VMT and Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions for LAUSDs consideration No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the MND were raised therefore no further response is necessary LAUSD acknowledges that any transportation of heavy construction equipment andor materials which requires use of oversizedtransport vehicles on State highways will need a Caltrans transportation permit that large size truck trips should be limited to offpeak commute periods and that a Construction Traffic Worksite Traffic Control Plan would be needed if construction traffic would cause delays on State facilities No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary D Response to Comments from Adrian Scott Fine Los Angeles Conservancy November D Mr Fine Director of Advocacy at the Los Angeles Conservancy thanked LAUSD for providing the opportunity to comment on the ISMND provided a general summary of the historic nature of the campus and appreciated LAUSDs sensitivity and preservation minded approach to the rehabilitation and modernization of the Lincoln HS Campus No issues related to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the ISMND were raised therefore no further response is necessary D The Commenter expressed potential concerns regarding proposed interior modifications and would like more details of proposed changes Furniture and artwork are not considered characteristic of the historic buildings at Lincoln HS In addition the building interiors at Lincoln have been significantly modified over the years That said the District still recognizes the importance of these items to the greater school community As previously noted in response A these items will be stored and reinstalled in their original locations whenever possible although a few items will need to be relocated because of changing spaces and dimensions postProject The space with the most interior character is the Auditorium where most of the features are being retained or in some cases even enhanced Furthermore as noted on MND page throughout the proposed Project LAUSD shall implement processes and professionals who meet the Secretary of the

study would like to know why the HRG study cited possible adverse changes to district contributors and strongly recommends an expansion of the analysis to identify historicdefining interior spaces features and finishes of contributing buildings to plan for retention and preservation of historic buildings and features The ISMND incorporates the information provided in the HRG study Based on the information available LAUSD assumes the HRG study cited possible adverse changes would result from any changes made to the interior or exterior of district contributing buildings if the changes were not consistent with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties because this language is the standard by which historic evaluations are completed under CEQA As previously noted the compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards is a required component of the Project as documented by the Project as defined and as evaluated with SCs SCCUL SCCUL and SCCUL through SCCUL The HRG study included a list of exterior character defining features for contributing buildings within the district and included as an attachment to the study a memorandum from Rincon Consultants Inc sent to LAUSD in prior to the completion of the HRG study This memorandum includes a brief list of some of the interior historicdefining spaces for four of the contributing buildings to the historic district The entire HRG report including the memorandum will be used in the planning and retention of historic buildings and features No further expansion of the HRG study is currently proposed However SCCUL and SC CUL will address the commenters concerns related to historicdefining interior spaces features and finishes of contributing buildings The Secretary of the Interiors Qualified Historic Architect retained under SCCUL shall provide input throughout the design process to ensure compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and LAUSD requirements and guidelines for the treatment of historical resources D Commenter indicates that Lincoln HS campus represents a limited and increasing diminishing resource type and is characteristic of the PWA Moderne style The Conservancy greatly appreciates LAUSDs preservation approach However the Conservancy has concerns about the potential loss of character defining interior features and suggests further study LAUSD will take all the written comments received under consideration The commenter provided a summary conclusion of their comment letter and

Project Design Features Project design features PDFs are environmental protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and SCs there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs LAUSD is the responsible party for compliance with all measures related to the proposed Project Specifically LAUSD is responsible for compliance with and implementation of all of the mitigation measures that are outlined in this MMRP and stated in the associated ISMND for the proposed Project PROJECT LOCATION The approximately acre Campus spans across two parcels and is separated by Lincoln Park Avenue The

Rep Version Student Impact The proposed Project upon completion will help ensure that the students attending Lincoln High School are provided with a safe and healthy environment and updated facilities that promote learning Issues and Analysis Environmental OEHS evaluated the proposed Project to determine potential impacts on the environment in accordance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines This evaluation as documented in the Initial Study IS resulted in the preparation of an MND The MND was circulated for a day public review period from October to November The analysis documented in the ISMND found that the proposed Project would not result in significant and unavoidable impacts as a result of construction or operation of the proposed Project Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines prior to the proposed Project proceeding into construction the Board must adopt the MND and subsequently must approve the proposed Project Project Development The design and development of the proposed Project continues to progress Various preconstruction planning and design activities have been completed This includes community and stakeholder engagement a review of changes in current and projected enrollment which informed additional design and scope decisions to be made The proposed Project scope has been modified to include the following updates classrooms as opposed to the previously anticipated nine classrooms will be constructed in new buildings The reconfiguration and structural upgrades to the Administration Building and Home Economics Building are anticipated to yield one less classroom than previously anticipated in renovated spaces The kitchen and scramble service areas within the Home Economics Building will be renovated and upgraded to address code compliant issues associated with food distribution and preparation The existing lunch shelter will be upgraded with a new fire alarm and fire sprinkler system that comply with code requirements associated with the path of travel between the Home Economics Building and the lunch shelter The athletic field areas require restroom and concession facilities to safely accommodate athletic events and use of the fields A new restroom building and homevisitor concession stands will be constructed and the gymnasium renovations will include expanded restrooms to support the fields The existing batting cages and associated site infrastructure required for the restrooms and concessions will be demolished replaced andor relocated as necessary The logistical challenges to construct the proposed Project while keeping the school operational during construction require multiple phases of construction the placement of interim housing onsite and now the removal and replacement of existing aging and deteriorating relocatable buildings utilized by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School During construction of the proposed Project the Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School Program will be temporarily relocated to existing available classroom space at Glen Alta Elementary School The temporary relocation will allow for necessary construction activities to support the Project

School Districts LAUSDs CEQA required mitigation measures identified in the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Administrative MediaLiteracy Kitchen Building Project Mitigated Negative Declaration MND State Clearinghouse No This MMRP has been prepared in conformance with Section of the Public Resources Code and LAUSD practice Section states a When making findings required by paragraph of subdivision a of Section or when adopting a mitigated negative declaration pursuant to paragraph of subdivision c of Section the following requirements shall apply The public agency shall adopt a reporting or monitoring program for the changes made to the project or conditions of project approval adopted in order to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment The reporting or monitoring program shall be designed to ensure compliance during project implementation For those changes which have been required or incorporated into the project at the request of a responsible agency or a public agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by the project that agency shall if so requested by the lead or responsible agency prepare and submit a proposed reporting or monitoring program The charter school Project is subject to the California Department of Education CDE design and siting requirements and the school architectural designs are subject to review and approval by the California Division of the State Architect DSA The proposed Project is required to comply with specific design standards and sustainable building practices Certain standards assist in reducing environmental impacts such as the California Green Building Code CALGreen Code LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval SC and the Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools CHPS criteria California Green Building Code Part of the California Building Standards Code is the California Green Building Standards Code also known as the CALGreen Code The CALGreen Code is a statewide green building standards code and is applicable to residential and nonresidential buildings throughout California California Green Building Standards Code Title Part Program EIR for the School Upgrade Program Report httpachievelausdnetceqa The Board of Educations October Resolution on Sustainability and Design of High Performance Schools directs staff to continue its efforts to ensure that every new school and modernization project in the District from the beginning of the design process incorporate CHPS Collaborative for High Performance Schools criteria to the extent possible including schools The CALGreen Code was developed to reduce GHG from buildings promote environmentally responsible costeffective healthier places to live and work reduce energy and water consumption and respond to the environmental directives of the Department of Housing and Community Development Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects SCs were adopted by the BOE on February Board Report Number SCs are environmental standards that are applied to District construction upgrade and improvement projects during the environmental review process by the OEHS California Environmental Quality Act CEQA team to offset potential environmental impacts The SCs were largely compiled from established LAUSD standards guidelines specifications practices plans policies and programs For each SC applicability is triggered by factors such as the project type and existing conditions These SCs are implemented during the planning construction and operational phases of the projects The Board of Education adopted a previous version of the SCs on November Board Report Number They were originally compiled as a supplement to the Program Environmental Impact Report Program EIR for the School Upgrade Program which was certified by the BOE on November also Board Report No The most recently adopted SCs were updated in order to incorporate and reflect recent changes in the laws regulations and the Districts standard policies practices and specifications eg the Design Guidelines and Design Standards which are routinely updated and are referenced throughout the Standard Conditions Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools The proposed Project would include CHPS criteria points under seven categories Integration Indoor Environmental Quality Energy Water Site Materials and Waste Management and Operations and Metrics LAUSD is committed to sustainable construction principles and has been a member of the CHPS since CHPS has established criteria for the development of high performance schools to create a better educational experience for students and teachers by designing the best facilities possible CHPSdesigned facilities are healthy comfortable energy efficient material efficient easy to maintain and operate commissioned environmentally responsive site a building that teaches safe and secure community resource stimulating architecture and adaptable to changing needs The proposed Project would comply with CHPS and LAUSD sustainability guidelines The design team would be responsible for incorporating sustainability features for the proposed Project including onsite treatment of stormwater runoff cool roof building materials lighting that reduces light pollution water and energyefficient design water wise landscaping collection of recyclables and sustainable andor recycledcontent building materials Project Design Features Project design features PDFs are environmental protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and SCs there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is the project proponent and developer of this Project and as such has assumed all of the responsibilities that would typically be attributed to LAUSD Where Standard Conditions of Approval or other measures identify LAUSD as the responsible party it is understood that Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is in fact the responsible party for compliance with these and all measures related to the proposed Project Specifically Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is responsible for compliance with and implementation of all of the measures that are outlined in this MND for the proposed Project PROJECT LOCATION The Project

California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Public Resources Code Division Sections et seq and the CEQA Guidelines California Code of Regulations Title Division Chapter Sections et seq a lead agency has no affirmative duty to prepare formal responses to comments on an MND The lead agency however should have adequate information on the record explaining why the comments do not affect the conclusion of the MND In the spirit of public disclosure and engagement the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSDas the lead agency for the proposed Projecthas responded to all written comments submitted during the day public review period PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Notice of Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration Per CEQA Guidelines Section and the LAUSD determined that an MND would be required for this proposed Project and circulated a Notice of Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration NOI and the MND The public review period for this CEQA document was from September to October Public outreach for the MND included the following methods US Postal Mail NOI sent to addresses within feet of project site owneroccupant mailings NOI sent to Los Angeles County Clerk Document Availability The NOI and MND were available for review at the following locations LAUSD website at httpachievelausdnetceqa Vaughn Next Century Learning Center website at wwwmyvaughnchartercom California State

Project and the MND DOCUMENT FORMAT This document is organized as follows Section Introduction This section describes CEQA requirements and content of this document Section Response to Comments This section provides a list of agencies organizations and interested persons that commented on the MND comment letters received during the public review period and individual responses to written comments To facilitate review of the responses each comment letter has been reproduced and assigned a letter Individual comments in each letter are numbered and each letter is followed by responses with reference to the corresponding comment number CEQA REQUIREMENTS REGARDING COMMENTS AND RESPONSES CEQA Guidelines Section b outlines parameters for submitting comments on MNDs and reminds persons and public agencies that the focus of review and comment should be on the proposed finding that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment If the commenter believes that the project may have a significant effect it should Identify the specific effect Explain why they believe the effect would occur and Explain why they believe the effect would be significant Comments are most helpful when they suggest additional specific alternatives or mitigation measures that would provide better ways to avoid or mitigate the significant environmental effects At the same time reviewers should be aware that the adequacy of an MND is determined in terms of what is reasonably feasible Section d also states Each responsible agency and trustee agency shall focus its comments on environmental information germane to that agencys statutory responsibility Section e states This section shall not be used to restrict the ability of reviewers to comment on the general adequacy of a document or of the lead agency to reject comments not focused as recommended by this section Finally CEQA does not require a lead agency to conduct every test or perform all research study and experimentation recommended or demanded by commenters Written responses to comments are not required for MNDs however it is LAUSDs policy to respond in writing to all comments When responding to comments lead agencies need only respond to potentially significant environmental issues and do not need to provide all information requested by reviewers as long as a good faith effort at full disclosure is made in the environmental document This page intentionally left blank Response to Comments This section has the written comments received on the circulated MND and LAUSDs response to

Services Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Board of Education Board as Lead Agency under the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA for the proposed project approve the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Vaughn New TwoStory Addition Project Project being developed and constructed by Vaughn on the existing District owned Vaughn campus located at Vaughn Street in the San Fernando area of Los Angeles The Boards approval will authorize Vaughn to proceed with the construction of the Project The current proposed Project budget is of which is funded by a Los Angeles Unified School District Los Angeles Unified augmentation grant funded by Bond Program funds earmarked for charter school facilities Staff further proposes that the Board authorize the Chief Procurement Officer andor the Chief Facilities Executive andor their designees to execute reasonable instruments as legally permissible to support Vaughns implementation of the proposed Project The Office of the Environmental Health and Safetys OEHS evaluation of the proposed Project resulted in the preparation of a Mitigated Negative Declaration MND and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA Guidelines and to permit construction activities to commence at a later date staff is requesting the Board approve the proposed Project The proposed action may only be considered after the Board adopts the MND prepared by OEHS in compliance with CEQA and State CEQA Guidelines for the proposed Project Board Report No Background Vaughn operates five contiguous campuses under one charter serving approximately students in grades TKth One of the campuses is located at the former District operated Vaughn Elementary School that was converted to charter use in Vaughn operates the Districtowned site pursuant to a Sole Occupancy Agreement SOA Four of the five campuses are located on sites immediately adjacent to one another and the fifth site is less than miles away from the others The private sites are located at Vaughn Street in San Fernando Herrick Avenue and Herrick Avenue in the Pacoima area of Los Angeles The District owned site is located at Vaughn Street in the San Fernando area of Los Angeles The Vaughn sites are located within the boundaries of San FernandoSylmar Community of Schools Local District Northeast and Board District Kelly Gonez On January the Board approved Vaughns renewed charter petition to serve up to students in grades TKth for a fiveyear term ending on June Board Report No On May the Board amended the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan to approve a charter augmentation grant for the Project and authorized staff to negotiate and execute agreements for the financing of the Project Board Report No Vaughn will fund its half of the Project budget with its capital reserve fund Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version The proposed Project consists of the removal of the existing onestory administration building and replacement with a new twostory building that will include six learning pods equivalent to classrooms health and administrative offices a medialiteracy center a teacher work room and a cafeteria to serve elementary aged students The Project is required to receive approvals from the Division of State Architect DSA California Department of Education and if applicable Department of Toxic Substances Control Additionally the proposed Project must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act and be constructed to be Field Act compliant The proposed Project is anticipated to start construction during the second quarter of and be completed by the second quarter of Upon completion of the proposed Project Vaughn will be able to accommodate the enrollment growth in accordance with its approved charter petition The Project will continue to provide a long term location for Vaughn who has waived its rights under Proposition for the term its current SOA Expected Outcomes Staff anticipates that the Board will adopt staffs proposal which will permit construction activities to be undertaken by Vaughn at a later date once DSA approval is secured Board Options and Consequences Adoption of staffs proposal will permit Vaughn to proceed with the construction of the proposed Project after DSA approval is secured which is needed to provide adequate classroom space to accommodate Vaughns planned enrollment growth of students If the proposed action is not adopted Vaughn will not have sufficient space to accommodate the planned and Boardapproved enrollment growth and may have to consider increasing class sizes to serve students within its existing capacity Moreover Vaughn will not have additional facilities such as the medialiteracy pod a teacher work and professional development room to support its instructional program Policy Implications The proposal supports the implementation of the proposed Project which the Board approved a Charter Augmentation Grant for on May Board Report No and helps facilitate the implementation of the Facilities Services Division Strategic Execution Plan Budget Impact The proposed action does not have a budget impact The Board previously authorized funding in the amount of for the proposed Project Board Report No comprised of as an augmentation grant to Vaughn for the construction of the Project with the balance covering Los Angeles Unifieds oversight to ensure compliance with Los Angeles Unifieds guidelines and approvals Funding for the proposed Project will be provided from Bond Program funds earmarked for charter school facilities projects Vaughn anticipates funding the remaining with funds from its capital reserve The region continues to experience construction price cost escalation Determining the most appropriate budget assumptions for the proposed Project is challenging at this time since the design is incomplete DSA approval has not been secured and the volatile nature of the market If Vaughns estimated cost for the DSA approved design andor receipt of bids results in an increase in their Project budget and a request for an increase to the augmentation grant awarded by Los Angeles Unified staff will return to the Board to request authorization for the requested increase Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Student Impact The proposed Project once complete will help ensure that students attending Vaughn are provided with a safe and

Human Resources Division Action Proposed Staff proposes that the Human Resources Divisions request for two teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit be approved pursuant to Title California Code of Regulations Section Background The Provisional Internship Permit became effective on July in anticipation of the phasing out of the former authorizing document The Provisional Internship Permit is valid for one year and may not be renewed During the first year of employment the Provisional Intern teacher must meet all requirements for entrance into an accredited intern program The Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional Internship Permit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teachers beginning their assignment The CTC requires that the governing board be presented with a list of teachers to be employed under the Provisional Internship Permit Attachment A Additionally the CTC requires that the approval of these Permits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the consent agenda Expected Outcomes The approval of Provisional Internship Permits will enable the District to continue to staff teacher vacancies in shortage subject fields with individuals committed to completing the requirements to enter into an intern program and subsequently earn a full credential Board Options and Consequences Approval of Provisional Internship Permits will afford the District the opportunity to hire new special education teachers who will be required to follow a prescribed and rigorous pathway that results in the earning of both full state and federal teacher certification If the Provisional Internship Permits are not approved and a fulltime teacher cannot be hired classroom vacancies would be staffed by a series of individuals in possession of only Emergency Day Substitute Teaching Permits Daytoday substitutes are not required to be enrolled in a teacher education program and may only remain in a special education classroom for a maximum of twenty days after which time they are deemed by the State as inappropriately assigned Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Policy Implications This action does not change District policy Budget Impact There is no impact on the Districts budget Student Impact The goal of the Human Resources Division is to insure that there is an appropriately authorized teacher in every classroom In areas of

Res Whereas Parent and community engagement is an integral component of the success of our students and schools Whereas There is historic inequity in the level of community engagement and investment across schools and communities that is often seen as inevitable when it does not have to be and belies the dedication that parents and communities have for their local schools Whereas California ranks near the bottom nationally in perpupil funding with students in Los Angeles receiving approximately half as much money per student as those in New York City Whereas The states underfunding of public education puts an extra burden on teachers and school staff to do more with fewer resources in their efforts to prepare all students for success in college career and life Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District must continue to pursue strategies likely to increase District revenues including but not limited to enrollment stabilization and growth parcel tax and school bond measures property tax reform legislative and executive advocacy at the local state and federal level and philanthropic support as directed in Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas For the time being while this underinvestment persists the District should be doing more to equitably help schools develop fundraising efforts through local investments now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to develop a plan wherein the District can best help schools increase parent engagement including but not limited to cid Facilitating community partnerships and school adoptions cid Reducing the burden on parents by becoming the fiscal sponsor for booster clubs cid Streamlining the paperwork and approval process for fundraisers and school events cid Connecting community and business partners to opportunities for equitable investment in our schools Resolved further That this plan focus on increasing equitable parent and community fundraising investments by providing District support for schools that dont yet have robust parent groups or community partnerships and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent present this plan to the Board within days The following resolution was postponed from the September Regular Board meeting and referred to the Legislative Advocacy Committee Ms Gonez Expanding the Electorate to Raise the Voices of All Parents in the Los Angeles Unified School District Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District represents an incredibly diverse population of students and families including languages spoken and over different nationalities Whereas The We Are One LA Unified campaign was created to affirm that our schools are safe and welcoming places for immigrant students and families and to provide information and resources to help ensure their success including particular supports for undocumented students and students from mixedstatus families Whereas Education is a constitutional right for all students regardless of their familys immigration status Plyler v Doe and approximately percent of children living in Southern California have at least one immigrant noncitizen parent Urban Institute of Children of Immigrants Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has repeatedly affirmed its support for our immigrant students and families and the assets they bring to our schools including through Demanding Action on DREAMs Deferred Finding a Permanent Resolution for Undocumented Youth and Temporary Protected Status Beneficiaries Res Putting Kids First Means Keeping Families Together Res Declaring March as Immigrant Student Family and District Staff Month Res and Reaffirmation of Los Angeles Unified School District Schools as Safe Zones for Families Threatened by Immigration Enforcement Res Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas All Los Angeles Neighborhood Councils which serve as the grassroots level of the Citys government allow all noncitizens to participate in their elections administered through EmpowerLA Whereas Members of the Board of Education are democratically elected to represent all the students families and communities within their respective geographic Board districts Whereas Studies show that engaged and involved parents can have a significant impact on a students ability to succeed in school including improved academic skills attendance graduation rates and college readiness Whereas In voters in San Francisco Unified School District passed a measure to ensure parental voting rights for their Board of Education regardless of immigration status and Whereas Parents regardless of citizenship status are recognized by the District as critical partners in their childrens education and work in partnership through standing committees at the school Local District and Central levels including involvement in the process to create the Districts Local Control and Accountability Plan now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District affirms that all parents in Los Angeles have an equal stake in the important decisions made by this governing body and in the selection of their respective representative on the Board Resolved further That the Board directs the Superintendent and the Office of General Counsel to conduct relevant research on a proposal for a potential future ballot measure to extend voting rights to all parents grandparents legal guardians or caregivers of a child residing within the boundaries of Los Angeles Unified School District to vote in elections for the Governing Board Resolved further That the Superintendent organize a study group to inform the development of this proposal that includes parents immigrant advocacy organizations civic engagement organizations the Registrars Office the Office of the City Clerk labor partners and key District staff Resolved further The study group examine the issues related to the implementation of such a proposal including the registration process for noncitizen voters potential impacts on non citizen voters and the naturalization process outreach and recruitment efforts as well as other issues drawing from the acquired knowledge of efforts in other municipalities to expand voting rights to noncitizens Resolved further That the proposal include strategies for assuring the confidentiality of the right to vote and assuaging fears of retaliation due to immigration status and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent shall present this research and the study groups proposal to the Board at a public meeting within days Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm The following resolution as amended was referred to the Curriculum and Instruction Committee Ms Goldberg Ensuring Support for Students at All Los Angeles Unified School District Schools Res Noticed September Whereas The value of a public school cannot be quantified in a single summative rating which can shame penalize or stigmatize schools education professionals students and entire communities Whereas School ratings promote unhealthy competition between schools exacerbate community antagonisms by producing artificial winners and losers and penalize schools that serve socioeconomically disadvantaged student populations Whereas It is wellunderstood that the academic achievement gap continues to be perpetuated by socioeconomic and socioemotional factors Whereas School ranking systems that prioritize student performance on standardized tests fail to adequately take into account socioeconomic and socioemotional factors that influence school needs and are reflected in the academic achievement levels of students Whereas Research indicates that online school performance achievement ratings exacerbate economic and social segregation in the United States accelerating divergences in housing values income distributions education levels and the racial and ethnic composition of communities Whereas On April the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District adopted Achieving Excellence for All Establishing a Framework for Continuous Improvement Res which called for the development of a School Performance Framework SPF that would enable the District to identify and track the overall performance of each school annually and evaluate all schools with a uniform set of measures Whereas The proposed SPF presented to the Board on November heavily relies on ValueAdded Growth modeling a technique subject to variability and error which is therefore inappropriate for highstakes evaluations resulting in rankings categorization or absolute comparisons Whereas The proposed SPF seeks included the requirement to distill the natural and inherent complexity of a school community into a single summative rating Whereas Identifying schools and students meeting or not meeting proficiency level benchmarks to inform the provision of support and resources is a task already conducted by District administrators principals and teachers on an almost daily basis and Whereas Rather than having to implement a summative school ranking system the Superintendent and Local District Superintendents should be permitted to focus on continuous improvement using multiple measures such as student growth responsible reclassification and school climate to addressing the academic achievement gap experienced by students from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities lacking financial political and social capital now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District suspend implementation of the SPF and any launching or utilization of the SPFincluding any use of stars scores or any other rating systemin or on any District platforms until a more indepth analysis of the SPFs metrics is conducted by the members of the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District andor an adhoc committee to understand the implications and impact of the SPF on District schools and their residing neighborhoods Resolved further That the District further the goal of giving students parents school employees and the general public more information about District schools by including important and wide ranging types of data from the California Department of Educations California School Dashboard on its website in an accessible fashion Resolved further That the District will provide parents with a guide and workshops on how to utilize the California School Dashboard Resolved further That the District collaborate with the California Department of Education to improve the California School Dashboard based on school community and parent feedback Resolved further That Local District personnel work closely with the administrators and teachers of schools with large numbers of students experiencing difficulties meeting or exceeding state standards to help increase the number of students meeting and exceeding state standards at these schools and be it finally Resolved further The funds designated to implement the SPF be equitably distributed according to need between i Local Area Districts tasked with identifying schools that serve high concentrations of highneeds students experiencing difficulty performing academically and ii supports that can be provided to increase academic performance among those students and be it finally Resolved That the schools both District and

Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD Historic Resources Group has evaluated the Lincoln High School campus at N Broadway in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles for potential historic significance This historic assessment analyzes the propertys eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources and for designation as a City of Los Angeles HistoricCultural Monument This assessment was conducted by Christine Lazzaretto Managing Principal and Kari Fowler Senior Preservation Planner both of whom are qualified professionals who meet or exceed the Secretary of the Interiors Professional Qualification Standards In the Lincoln High School campus was evaluated as part of a larger effort to survey properties damaged by the Northridge earthquake At that time the original buildings of the reconstructed post Long Beach earthquake campus were identified collectively as a historic district consisting of four contributors the Administration Building the Home Economics Building the Auditorium Building and the Physical Education Building all of which were designed by noted Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin The Lincoln High School Historic District was formally determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and was therefore listed in the California Register of Historical Resources The listing for Lincoln High School does not identify the criteria under which the historic district was determined to be eligible however it is presumed to have been evaluated under Criterion C for its architectural merit and as the work of a master architect The purpose of this historic assessment was to complete an evaluation of the Lincoln High School campus using applicable criteria and eligibility requirements as described in the LAUSD Historic Context Statement and other historic context statements where applicable In particular Lincoln High School was evaluated for its association with the East Los Angeles Walkouts or Chicano Blowouts of It should be noted that this historic assessment reviewed and incorporated preliminary historic research conducted by Rincon Consultants Inc as part of a previous Historical Resources Evaluation for Lincoln High School conducted in November [See Appendix H Rincon Consultants Inc Memorandum below] Historic Resources Group has conducted a detailed historic assessment of the Lincoln High School campus property including visual observation of the existing conditions a review of primary and secondary source research related to the history of the school and its development a review of the relevant historic contexts and themes as established by the National Historic Landmarks Program the National Register of Historic Places SurveyLA and the LAUSD and an analysis under the criteria and integrity thresholds for listing at the federal state and local levels The Lincoln High School campus has been evaluated collectively for its potential eligibility for listing andor designation as a historic district The campus has a layered history therefore consistent with standard historic preservation practice Historic Resources Group has identified HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP three overlapping historic districts and five distinct reasons for historic significance Each identified historic district has its own period of significance boundary and contributing and noncontributing buildings and features Two historic districts were identified as significant under Criterion A one for its association with earlyth century school development in Los Angeles including remnant features from when the school was initially established on the site in and the other for its association with the Chicano Blowouts of Two historic districts were identified as significant under Criterion B one for its association with longtime Lincoln High School principal Ethel Percy Andrus and the other for its association with Lincoln High School teacher Sal Castro Finally one historic district was identified as significant under Criterion C as an excellent example of PWA Moderne architecture and the work of prominent Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin To summarize these findings a total of four campus buildings and seven additional features landscapes hardscapes athletic facilities have been evaluated as contributing to one or more identified historic districts Thus this historic assessment has concluded that the Lincoln High School

historic places worthy of preservation The National Register Program is administered by the National Park Service US Department of the Interior To be eligible for listing andor listed in the National Register a resource must possess significance in American history and culture architecture or archaeology Listing in the National Register is primarily honorary and does not in and of itself provide protection of a historic resource The primary effect of listing in the National Register on private owners of historic buildings is the availability of financial and tax incentives In addition for projects that receive Federal funding a clearance process must be completed in accordance with Section of the National Historic Preservation Act Furthermore state and local regulations may apply to properties listed in the National Register The criteria for listing in the National Register follow established guidelines for determining the significance of properties The quality of significance in

Integrity In addition to meeting any or all of the evaluation criteria eligible properties must also possess historic integrity Historic integrity is the ability of a property to convey its significance and is defined as the authenticity of a propertys historic identity evidenced by the survival of physical characteristics that existed during the propertys historic period The National Register recognizes seven aspects or qualities that comprise integrity location design setting materials workmanship feeling and association These qualities are defined as follows Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the historic event took place Design is the combination of elements that create the form plan space structure and style of a property Setting is the physical environment of a historic property Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular period of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a historic property Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any given period in history or prehistory Feeling is a propertys expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time Association is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic property Period of Significance The National Park Service defines period of significance as the length of time when a property was associated with important events activities or persons or attained the characteristics

Districts Standard preservation practice evaluates collections of buildings from similar time periods and historic contexts as historic districts The National Park Service defines a historic district as a significant concentration linkage or continuity of sites buildings structures or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development A historic district derives its significance as a single unified entity According to the National Park Service a district can comprise both features that lack individual distinction and individually distinctive features that serve as focal points It may even be considered eligible if all of the components lack individual distinction provided that the grouping achieves significance as a whole within its historic context In either case the majority of the components that add to the districts historic character even if they are individually undistinguished must possess integrity as must the district as a whole Examples of

of the lands occupied by the original Pueblo de Los ngeles In the land was presented to Dr John S Griffin in appreciation of his services to the people of the pueblo Dr Griffin deeded the land to his nephew Hancock Johnson who in turn sold it to a French nobleman Baron de Roguiat The Baron and his wife built a beautiful home on the site where they lived for eight years until the residence was destroyed by fire The Baron subsequently sold the land to Thomas L Woolwine who erected his own impressive residence on the hilltop property along what was then Downey Avenue In the population of Los Angeles was and the area served by the Los Angeles City School District spanned over square miles with some students enrolled By the Avenue TwentyOne Grammar School had been converted to an intermediate school and was growing so rapidly that it was in need of a new facility The former Woolwine estate was selected as an ideal location for a new school The Board of Education under Superintendent JH Francis purchased the property and soon plans for a new school campus were underway It was at this time that a bridge was constructed across the Los Angeles River linking expanding eastside neighborhoods with the central part of the city The bridge would connect Broadway in downtown Los Angeles with Buena Vista Street and Downey Avenue both of which were subsequently renamed N

school reconstruction began throughout the region the Los Angeles City School District insisted upon buildings that were at once seismically sound and aesthetically modern The LAUSD Historic Context Statement quotes a Los Angeles Times article stating new and repaired buildings would be designed for absolute safety with simplicity and beauty of architecture in harmony with the atmosphere and traditions of Southern California While many designs were executed by the districts architectural department bids were also issued to outside architects In either case buildings were expected to be explicitly Southern Californian in design and free of needless ornamentation which often failed and fell to the ground during earthquakes This directive by the school district would mark both a move away from the period revival styles in the s as well as a prioritization of seismic safety The reconstruction of Lincoln High School was included in this districtwide school rebuilding effort and soon plans were underway to erect a new campus on the adjacent block Prominent Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin was engaged to develop a campus plan and design four buildings and associated landscapes Principal Andrus was also instrumental in the design of the schools new campus expressing her intention that it resemble a college campus Beginning in Martin laid out an expansive new campus what was

Mission RoadSoto Street It is oriented around North Broadway originally Downey Avenue which is prominently intersected by the northsouth route of Daly StreetPasadena Avenue Originally known as East Los Angeles for its location east of the Los Angeles River Lincoln Heights was first subdivided in from a portion of the original Pueblo de Los Angeles Along with Boyle Heights it was one of the citys first suburbs Its subdividers established waterlines and a horsedrawn streetcar line later replaced by interurban electric railway lines to reach the new home lots of East Los Angeles luring middle and uppermiddle class residents to construct homes outside of the urban core In the opening of a large public hospital today part of the Los Angeles CountyUSC Medical Center marked the arrival of the neighborhood By the turn of the th century the neighborhood had fully developed into an attractive residential area and business districts flourished along the major streets of Downey Avenue now North Broadway Kuhrts Avenue now Main Street and Daly StreetPasadena Avenue each of which held a streetcar line Recreational facilities like Eastlake Park now Lincoln Park first established in provided green space to the newly urbanized neighborhood During the first decades of the th century East Los Angeles became a destination for workingclass Angelenos of diverse ethnic backgrounds many of whom worked for industries oriented around the Southern Pacific Railroad which built its yards in the neighborhood in and established their households nearby Agricultural interests wineries breweries building materials manufacturers and all kinds of distributors operated out of Lincoln Heights Like Boyle Heights East Los Angeles was a neighborhood that served as a first point of entry for many of

population from an early date which expanded and diversified into a wider Latino American community during the postWorld War II population boom During the s Eastlake Park became the hub of a recreational district including a zoo a carousel an alligator farm and an ostrich farm as well as the artificial lake boathouse and expansive grounds for which it was already known In local residents voted to change the neighborhoods name to Lincoln Heights apparently inspired in part by the opening of Lincoln High School Much of Lincoln Heights built environment reflects its early development in the late th and early th centuries and the neighborhood contains a large number of intact singlefamily residences in various Victorian architectural styles including Queen Anne and EastlakeStick as well as more modest vernacular expressions of these highly articulated styles Multifamily properties were also common encompassing a range of types from duplex to fourflat to large apartment house though fewer examples of these survive Many of the neighborhoods earliest properties lie within the Lincoln Heights HPOZ Craftsman architecture from the s and s is also common while the ss Period

have participated in a series of student protest marches and walkouts in March of demanding better educational opportunities for Mexican American students in Los Angeles schools Known as the East Los Angeles Walkouts or Chicano Blowouts these protests took place at five Los Angeles area high schools Lincoln Roosevelt Garfield Wilson and Belmont where over the course of a week an estimated students left their classrooms and marched with supporters for access to better schools and a better education A number of additional Los Angeles schools also held protests in support of the walkouts Latinos in Twentieth Century California HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP The educational discrimination experienced by Mexican American students in Los Angeles schools was rooted in decades of policies which placed Mexican American students in vocational schools rather than in academic programs resulting in widespread school segregation Despite the landmark US Supreme Court case Brown vs Board of Education which had officially ended segregation in the schools factors such as ethnically separated neighborhoods language barriers and economic status contributed to de facto school segregation that persisted in Los Angeles During this period Los Angeles public schools utilized a tracking system whereby some schools offered more college preparatory classes while others prioritized vocational training In practice schools with large ethnic minority student populations often emphasized shop classes and home economics over a more academic curriculum which came to be seen as a systematic attempt to exclude minority students from college At that time it was estimated that only one in Mexican American students in Los Angeles schools earned a college degree In the University of California Los Angeles had fewer than Latino students in its student population of and only seven Latinos attended California State University Northridge Dropout rates for students at Lincoln Roosevelt Garfield and Belmont high schools ranged from an estimated percent to nearly percent which was consistent with the high school dropout rate for Mexican American students throughout the Southwest at this time Mexican American students suffered from low reading levels Mexican culture was often portrayed in stereotypical or derogatory ways in the classroom and speaking Spanish on campus was prohibited Efforts to combat these conditions began in the early s as Mexican Americans stepped up the fight for equality in all aspects of society motivated by a burgeoning Chicano civil rights movement The Chicano Movement grew rapidly as Mexican American students began forming their own organizations on college campuses In response to student pressure in the nations first Chicano Studies program was founded at California State University Los Shannon Davis Draft Supplemental Historic Resource

after an hour passed with no media in sight the protestors decided to march to the LAUSD school boards local office at Hazard Park approximately threequarters of a mile from Lincoln High School At the park the group was met by a television news crew Students asked the area superintendent to facilitate a meeting with the Board of Education but he refused saying he did not have that power and instead accompanied the students back to Lincoln High so that the school would not be penalized for the walkout Later that evening Castro met with student leaders at a local church informing them that there had been no arrangements for a meeting with the school board Disappointed the Lincoln students agreed to wait until the next day to see how the walkout was covered in the media and how the school

group of teachers parents and community leaders which served as a voice box for the fight for equal student rights in the aftermath of the walkouts Chief among their demands were calls for changes to the academic curriculum to reflect Mexican American history and culture bilingual education and the recruitment of teachers and administrators of Mexican descent in schools with a majority Mexican American student body Additional demands ranged from improvements to school buildings and smaller class sizes to Mexican food in the cafeteria At a subsequent meeting on March held at the Lincoln High School auditorium the Board presented their responses to each of the demands to a crowd of some attendees Presentations were made by student representatives teachers and parents from each of the four original walkout schools as well as by Sal Castro While the Board agreed with many of the demands their responses often refuted or defended against the students assertions or cited a lack of funding

history As reported in La Raza The first days of March of the year will be known in the new history of the Southwest as the days of the BLOWOUT Chicano students define Blowout as high school students walking out for a better education During those days more than high school students most of them Chicano walked out The walkouts did initiate reform in Los Angeles schools and inspired Latino students to stage similar protests throughout the Southwest including in Arizona Colorado and Texas The Los Angeles School Board eventually met a number of the students demands and Mexican American parents formed groups to monitor those changes More broadly the walkouts focused national attention for the first time on urban Chicanos as a vocal assertive minority group As noted by school board member Dr Julian Nava during the walkouts [t]he schools will not be the same hereafter In a look back years later a Los Angeles Times story entitled to Were Not Finished claimed that although there had been improvements in the conditions of Latino students such as the end to the previous ban on speaking Spanish in school there was much more to be accomplished Regardless of the failure to achieve all the

Stripped Classicism the PWA Moderne often incorporates elements of a number of styles including Classical Revival Spanish Colonial Revival Art Deco and Streamline Moderne Compared with the Streamline Moderne the PWA Moderne was more formal and symmetrical in its overall design with less emphasis on curvilinear shapes and horizontality This style is found throughout the United States particularly for institutional buildings funded through the PWA Although the PWA program was terminated in buildings continued to display these stylistic features Typical characterdefining features of the PWA Moderne style include an emphasis on the vertical axis symmetrical formal design composition and massing smooth wall surfaces generally exhibiting stucco concrete andor polished stone usually displays a flat roof piers often fluted or reeded separating recessed window channels and incorporation of shallow relief panels and interior murals Associated Design Professionals Albert C Martin Sr Albert

National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources and for designation as a Los Angeles HistoricCultural Monument as outlined above For each criterion guidelines provided by the National Park Service for evaluating a potential historic resource are discussed followed by an evaluation of the Lincoln High School campus under that criterion As noted above in order for a property to qualify for historic listing or designation it must be historically significant under one or more identified criteria for evaluation and it must also retain sufficient integrity to evoke the sense of place and time with which it is historically associated The buildings and features of the Lincoln High School campus have been evaluated collectively for their potential eligibility for listing andor designation as a historic district As noted above the National Park Service defines a historic district as a significant concentration linkage or continuity of sites buildings structures or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development The Lincoln High School campus is composed of a grouping of related buildings and features therefore consideration of this property as a potential historic district is an appropriate analytical framework for its evaluation Criterion A association with important events or broad patterns of history According to the National Park Service in order for a property to be considered significant under Criterion A it must be associated with a specific event marking an important moment in national state or local history or prehistory or a pattern of events or a historic trend that made a significant contribution to the development of a community state or the nation or both Furthermore mere association with historic events or trends is not sufficient in and of itself to qualify under this criterion the propertys specific association must be considered important as well Association

two noncontributors the Lunch Pavilion and Music Building No both of which are situated amid the contributors This historic district is significant under both the pre earthquake and post earthquake themes as it includes buildings and features from both periods of school construction As outlined in the LAUSD Historic Context Statement the pre theme captures an important period in the development of Los Angeles schools for two reasons First it represents the widespread reform of school design triggered by the Progressive Education Movement which called for more expansive school plants and more specialized facilities and programspecific buildings as opposed to the monumental bigblock school Secondly this period occurred before a statewide overhaul of school building codes and practices following the Long Beach earthquake which would transform school designs once again Architecturally schools from this period tended to employ one of the popular period revival styles of the day As one of the oldest high schools in the city the original Lincoln High School campus of was an excellent example of this period of school construction in Los Angeles In fact the LAUSD historic context statement uses an image of the campus circa to illustrate the type Spread out across a large hillside site it consisted of a collection of differentiated buildings and facilities devoted to various activities including a main building science building auditorium library music hall manual arts building gymnasium and an athletic field Its unified Neoclassical architecture not only reflected one of the popular periodrevival styles of the time but took quite literally the contemporary notion that a school should be a beautiful LAUSD Historic Context Statement LAUSD Historic Context Statement HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP temple to learning reflecting the communitys aspirations for itself and its youth Indeed newspaper articles of the time touted the new nineacre school site as a veritable acropolis and the planned campus as a distinctive landmark that would be pointed out with pride to visitors Because of the acreage required for these expanded openair campuses these schools tended to be constructed on the city periphery Such was the case for Lincoln High School which was erected on what was then the easternmost edge of Los Angeles For their communities school campuses were important symbols of civic identity In Lincoln High School was the namesake for the newly christened community of Lincoln Heights However because the vast majority of schools from this period were either substantially remodeled or completely demolished following the Long Beach earthquake intact examples are quite rare Indeed all of the original Lincoln High School campus buildings were ultimately demolished following the discovery that the soil beneath the buildings had slipped However the campus features situated at the base of the hill have remained largely intact for over one hundred years The original campus stairway and walkway along with the Mexican fan palms along N Broadway date from a time when campuses featured artfully designed and landscaped approaches which reflected a growing sense that public education was a community affair No campus buildings were erected at the bottom of the hillside site along N Broadway reflecting the tenet that buildings have generous setbacks taking into account adjacent traffic to ensure that classrooms were adequately buffered from street noise Rather all of the buildings were clustered on top of the hill as architects placed a premium on the patterns of the sun and interior illumination in order to make the best of natural light in the classroom Hence the bottom of the hill features the tennis courts Thus while the original Lincoln High School campus is no longer extant its remnant features are important reminders of its earliest period of development and reflect some of the major principles of school planning and design from the pre earthquake period in Los Angeles The remainder of the districts contributing buildings and spaces were designed by noted Los Angeles Albert C Martin and constructed between and These include the campus four main buildings Administration Home Economics Auditorium and Physical Education and its two primary outdoor landscapes the Campus Quad A and the Administration Courtyard B Also included are the entrance gates front lawns steps and retaining walls Taken together these features form the historic core of the post campus This portion of the campus reflects a number of the principles that guided campus planning and design during the postearthquake period of school reconstruction as

LAUSD Historic Context Statement LAUSD Historic Context Statement LAUSD Historic Context Statement HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP the Field Act of which mandated earthquakeresistant construction for all schools in California Under Field Act requirements high school buildings could not exceed two stories in height and must be constructed of modern materials such as reinforced concrete Other design tenets of the period were a continuation of the progressive reforms that had started before the earthquake such as preferences for a more childscaled openplan school which were also aligned with the goals of increased seismic safety These included the use of L and Ushaped building plans that accommodated courtyards and patio spaces and adequate indirect lighting and ventilation provided through generous bands of windows At Lincoln High School all four of the original buildings are one or twostories in height with reinforced concrete construction The two buildings with classrooms the Administration Building and the Home Economic Building display continuous ribbons of dividedlight doublehung wood windows with interior stairwells illuminated by floortoceiling groupings of wood awning windows Classroom windows often look out onto landscaped courtyards evidence of site planning that took into consideration sun patterns interior crosslighting views and ventilation For all of these reasons the historic core of the Lincoln High School campus is an excellent example of the major principles of school planning and design from the post earthquake period in Los Angeles Each of the contributing buildings features and spaces are highly intact and have been minimally altered over time The

events of the postwar period designed to address and correct decades of de facto racial segregation in Los Angeles schools By the s as the Civil Rights movement gained momentum this long brewing issue finally came to a head and formed an important part of the social context shaping the district during this timeIn LatinAmerican students in East Los Angeles staged a series of school strikes popularly known as the East LA Blowout During the first week of March approximately students walked out of classes at Woodrow Wilson Garfield Abraham Lincoln Theodore Roosevelt Belmont Venice and Jefferson high schools with demands for an equal qualitative and culturally relevant education As described above Lincoln High School was critical in the planning and organizing of the events that became known as

dismissed a list of grievances presented by a group of high school students the students approached Castro with the idea of staging a walkout Castro encouraged the students to organize and soon walkout committees were formed at each of the four East Los Angeles schools with another committee that included students from all four schools After months of planning the first of the organized student walkouts took place at Lincoln High School on March th Sal Castro led his students out of their classroom through the campus quad and onto the lawns and sidewalks in front of the school where they were joined by additional teachers and a group of community activists Of the over students at Lincoln High School at the time most of them walked out The following day students from Garfield Wilson and Roosevelt high schools participated in their own walkouts Intended as a media event organizers were frustrated by the lack of news coverage of the initial walkouts and thus scheduled a more coordinated walkout for March th This time the four original East Los Angeles schools were joined by Belmont High School Jefferson and Venice high schools though not associated with the Chicano walkouts held their own protests in solidarity As a result of his role in the walkouts Castro was ultimately charged with felony conspiracy and barred from returning to Lincoln High School which in turn sparked weeks of additional protests Beginning in September of supporters of Castro many of them parents of Lincoln High School students picketed in front of the school campus demanding his reinstatement Due to Lincoln High Schools central role in the walkouts and subsequent protests much of the news media coverage captured the activities that occurred in front of the Lincoln High School campus Film footage and still photographs of the walkouts themselves show the students gathering in the quad with signs marching toward the entrance of the Administration Building or passing through

students filling the lawns and sidewalks in front of the school with the core campus buildings visible in the background Similarly images of the proSal Castro protests show picketers on the sidewalk in front of Lincoln High School again with the core of the campus visible in the background Thus not only was the core of the Lincoln High School campus the visual backdrop of many of these events but these buildings and spaces as viewed from the public rightofway largely formed the publics perceptions of the Chicano Blowouts As noted above a number of documents have acknowledged the historic significance of the five Los Angeles walkout schools for their association with the Chicano Blowouts of including a National Historic Landmark theme study on racial segregation in public schools A

publicly participate and back students complaints to news media and school district officials The historic district that has been identified as significant for its association with Sal Castro coincides with the district identified under Criterion A for its association with the Chicano Blowouts more generally As described above this historic district is situated on the western parcel only and includes buildings spaces and features which figured prominently in the events that comprised the walkouts and their aftermath District contributors include the Administration Building the Home Economics Building the Auditorium Building and the Campus Quad A Also included are the entrance gates front lawns steps retaining walls and public sidewalk in front of the school The district also includes two noncontributors the Lunch Pavilion and Music Building No both of which are situated amid the contributors Each of the contributing buildings features and spaces are highly intact and have been minimally altered over time The district also contains two noncontributing buildings which are situated in close proximity to the contributors However due to their siting behind contributing buildings they are not visible from the public rightofway and therefore do not detract from the historic district The historic district as a whole retains integrity of Location Setting Design Materials Workmanship Feeling and Association from its period of significance Therefore the Lincoln High School campus Historic District is eligible for listing in the National Register under Criterion B and the California Register under Criterion and for designation as a HistoricCultural Monument under Criterion for its association with Sal Sal Castro fought for justice in education Los

ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP Castro For a list of district contributors and noncontributors and a map of the district boundary see Historic District above Criterion C architectural merit or work of a master According to the National Park Service in order for a property to be considered significant under Criterion C it must embody the distinctive characteristics of a type style period or method of construction or represent the work of a master architect builder or designer or possess high artistic values Distinctive characteristics are those physical features or traits that commonly recur in individual types styles periods or methods of construction To be eligible a property must clearly display sufficient characteristics to be considered a true representative example A master is a figure of generally recognized greatness in a field a known craftsman of consummate skill or an anonymous craftsman whose work is distinguishable by its characteristic style or quality A property is not eligible simply because it was designed by a prominent architect but rather must express a particular phase aspect idea or theme in his or her craft To be eligible for high artistic values a property must express aesthetic ideals or design concepts more fully than typical properties of the type Example of PWA Moderne ArchitectureWork of AC Martin The Lincoln High School campus is significant as a historic district Historic District under National Register Criterion C California Register Criterion and Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument Criterion under the theme of LAUSD Post Long Beach Earthquake School Plants as an excellent example of PWA Moderne architecture and as the work of master architect Albert C Martin The period of significance is to spanning the timeframe during which the buildings and features designed by Martin were constructed This historic district includes buildings spaces and features designed by prominent Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin On the western parcel district contributors include the Administration Building the Home Economics Building the Auditorium Building the Campus Quad A and the Administration Courtyard B On the eastern parcel the district includes the Physical Education Building Also included are the entrance gates front lawns steps and retaining walls in front of the school The district also includes two non contributors the Lunch Pavilion and Music Building No both of which are situated amid the contributors As outlined in the LAUSD Historic Context Statement the historical coincidence that PWA funding for school construction was becoming available just as Los Angeles prepared to repair or rebuild its many earthquakedamaged schools ultimately determined the look of many of the schools from this period National Register Bulletin HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP Created by the National Industrial Recovery Act the Public Works Administration PWA was founded within a few months of the March Long Beach earthquake Following widespread damage to Los Angeles public schools in the wake of the earthquake much school reconstruction work was funded by the PWA Consequently a substantial number of Los Angeles public schools either built or remodeled during this time exhibit some degree of PWA Moderne styling The LAUSD historic context goes to note that in Southern California following PWA funding for school construction and reconstruction totaled over million a sum accounting for percent of the spending overall LAUSD school from this postearthquake were stylistically more streamlined and less ornamental than their s periodrevival counterparts The PWA Moderne style is sometimes referred to as Stripped Classicism incorporating elements of a number of styles including Classical Revival Spanish Colonial Revival Art Deco and Streamline Moderne but typically in a more restrained or strippeddown way Characterdefining features of the PWA Moderne style include an emphasis on the vertical axis symmetrical formal design composition and massing smooth wall surfaces generally exhibiting stucco concrete andor polished stone flat of lowpitched roofs piers often fluted or reeded separating recessed window channels and the incorporation of shallow relief panels interior murals and sculpture At Lincoln High School the Albert C Martindesigned buildings of the s and s are textbooks examples of the PWA Moderne architectural style as applied to school buildings during this period As described above features of these buildings included flat and lowpitch hipped roofs smooth stucco wall surfaces with vertically ribbed accent panels generous bands of dividedlight wood windows recessed building entrances with woodpanel multilight entry doors integrated concrete planters with rounded corners and minimal ornamentation Decorative elements are limited to a header course of concrete block ornament caststone basrelief panels and inspirational quotes incised in the concrete Additionally all of the LAUSD Historic Context Statement LAUSD Historic Context Statement LAUSD Historic Context Statement Interior WPA art pieces on the campus include two wall paintings entitled History of Los Angeles Parts I and II by Manuel de la Torre and two basrelief wall panels Knowledge by Conjecta Troncale and Progress by Maurice Levine dates unknown All of these art pieces are extant in the Administration Building HISTORIC RESOURCE ASSESSMENT REPORT Lincoln High School N Broadway Los Angeles HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP contributing buildings features and spaces of this historic district were designed by one of the most successful and prolific architects in earlyth century Los Angeles Albert C Martin The historic district confirms the finding which evaluated the historic core of the post earthquake campus as a historic district that was eligible for the listing National Register of Historic Places and listed in the California Register of Historical Resources Each of the contributing buildings features and spaces are highly intact and have been minimally altered over time The district also contains two noncontributing buildings which are situated in close proximity to the contributors and the detract somewhat from the historic district In particular the Lunch Pavilion replaced a portion of the Campus Quad and obscures views of the Home Economic Buildings north and westfacing facades Additionally in the Administration Courtyard portions of lawns have been replaced with semicircular concrete and concrete block paving and inground planters Despite these alterations the historic district as a whole retains integrity of Location Setting Design Materials Workmanship Feeling and Association from its period of significance Therefore the Lincoln High School campus Historic District is eligible for listing in the National Register under Criterion C and the California Register under Criterion and for designation as a HistoricCultural Monument under Criterion an excellent example of PWA Moderne architecture and as the work of master architect Albert C Martin The Lincoln High School campus contains three additional structures that were designed by noted Los Angeles architects Music Building No was designed by architect Edward H Fickett in While this building is designed in the MidCentury Modern style for which Fickett is best known it is not a particularly good distinctive or rare example of the style or of Ficketts work The Shop Building and Pedestrian Overpass were designed by architect Robert E Alexander with Adolpho E Mirrales Similarly neither of these structures are particularly good distinctive or rare examples of Alexanders work Thus none of these additional structures appears to be significant for its architectural merit or as the work of a master architect The California Historical Resources Inventory HRI lists Lincoln High School as a National Registereligible historic district with the four Albert C Martin buildings listed as district contributors While it has been suggested that Edward Fickett also did some landscape design at the Lincoln High School campus a review of his papers at USC Libraries Special Collections did not contain any documentation to this effect

HISTORIC RESOURCES GROUP CharacterDefining Features This section identifies the characterdefining features of each of the Lincoln High School campus buildings and features that have been evaluated as contributors to one or more of the identified historic districts Characterdefining features sometimes called essential physical features are those features that define both why a property is significant and when it was significant These features are illustrative of a historic propertys period type or style and contribute to its integrity thereby allowing the property to convey its historic significance In general if a property retains its important characterdefining features it is said to retain integrity from the period of significance and therefore is eligible as a historic resource The principal characterdefining features of the Lincoln High School campus are outlined below Because this historic assessment evaluates the campus primarily as a historic district this

Preliminary Historical Resources Evaluation of Abraham Lincoln High School North Broadway Los Angeles California Dear Ms HowellArdila Rincon Consultants Inc Rincon was retained by the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD to conduct a historical resources evaluation for the Abraham Lincoln High School campus subject campus located in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles California Methods included background research an intensivelevel field survey and an evaluation of the campus eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historical Places NRHP California Register of Historical Resources CRHR and for local designation Although a full Historical Resources Evaluation Report is forthcoming this Memorandum for the Record MFR was prepared to summarize the preliminary results of the evaluation and to identify contributing properties and characterdefining features as applicable All work was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA and applicable local regulations with the purpose of compliance with CEQA which requires lead agencies to consider the impacts of proposed projects on historical resources The current study confirms that the subject campus contains historical resources as discussed further in the following sections Campus Summary Construction Date s No of Buildings Previous Findings Current Findings Fifteen permanent twentyone portable The campus with four contributing resources was previously determined a historical resource in The campus with four contributing resources is confirmed as a previously determined a historical resource Total No of Historical Resources One district with four contributing resources E n v i r o n m e n t a l S c i e n t i s t s P l a n n e r s E n g i n e e r s Preliminary Historical Resources Evaluation of the Abraham Lincoln High School Los Angeles Unified School District Preliminary Results Site History The Abraham Lincoln High School campus was originally developed in the s on the hilly site east of presentday Lincoln Park Avenue As of the original campus included nine buildings and structures The Long Beach Earthquake of had disastrous effects on the Lincoln High School campus leading to the establishment of a new campus on the parcel west of Lincoln Park Avenue and the eventual demolition of the original buildings and structures The postearthquake Lincoln High School campus was designed by architect Albert C Martin in a distinctive Moderne architectural style Constructed in the campus included the administration auditorium and home economics buildings which are extant Three buildings that previously existed at the site were also incorporated into the new campus and are no longer extant The physical education building also designed by Albert C Martin and bleachers were constructed on the eastern hill site in Throughout the decades that followed additional permanent structures were incrementally added to the campus including but not limited to a small classroom building north of the Administrative Building two flammable storage buildings and two classroom buildings northeast of the Administrative Building a Music Building north of the Auditorium a twostory shop building at the eastern edge of the site a small food service building and various portable structures throughout the campus see Table below Page Preliminary Historical Resources Evaluation of the Abraham Lincoln High School Los Angeles Unified School District Previous Historical Resource Evaluations The Lincoln High School campus was evaluated following the Northridge Earthquake and was determined eligible through the Section process for listing in the NRHP as a historic district As a result it was automatically listed in the CRHR and is considered a historical resource Four buildings were identified as contributing resources the Administrative Building the Auditorium Building the Physical Education Building and the Home Economics Building The subject property was not recorded as part of the Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources citywide historic resources SurveyLA because this effort excluded individual resources and historic districts that are already designated including properties listed in or determined eligible for listing in the National Register listed in the California Register or designated locally as HistoricCultural Monuments HCMs of Historic Preservation Overlay Zones HPOZs Current Historical Resource Evaluation Available documentation from the previous determination does not include a statement indicating which NRHP or CRHR designation criteria the subject campus meets however a reasonable presumption is that this finding was based on the campus architecture Criteria C The current study found no evidence to suggest that the previous determination was based on erroneous information and the physical appearance of the school does not appear to have changed extensively since it was recorded in As a result the subject campus still meets Criteria C as well as Criterion at the local level In light of new information the subject campus also appears to meet the registration requirements identified in Los Angeles Unified School District Historic Context Statement under the theme of post Long Beach Earthquake School Plant The campus with these four contributing resources exemplifies postLong Beach earthquake school planning including requirements of the Field Act The campus and its contributing buildings retain most associative and characterdefining features from the period of significance including their integrated site plan and orientation to the outdoors twostory massing reinforced concrete construction generous expanses of windows and their PWA Moderne style with minimal Art Deco detailing Therefore the Lincoln High School Historic District is also eligible for the NRHP CRHR and local designation under Criteria A Pending further research to be presented in the full Historic Resources Evaluation Report the Lincoln High School campus may also be eligible for federal state and local designation under Criteria A and B at the local level for its significant associations with the Chicano Movement in Los Angeles in the late s and with the Lincoln High School social studies teacher Sal Castro an instrumental student organizer The Lincoln campus is a known location where protests walkouts and meetings took place as MexicanAmerican students asserted their rights to equal education Preliminary evidence indicates that the campus appears eligible within the established LAUSD theme LAUSD and the Civil Rights Movement At the current time contributing and noncontributing features and California

LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report INTRODUCTION The purpose of this report is to document existing traffic and circulation conditions at Abraham Lincoln High School Lincoln HS located at North Broadway in the Los Angeles Unified School Districts LAUSD East District in the Lincoln Heights community of the City of Los Angeles This report summarizes existing conditions including circulation operations for use in the facilities planning and design process for the Lincoln HS Comprehensive Modernization Project Observations include conditions and operations at adjacent intersections and roadway segments internal parking lots external parking lots and identified or reported issues Other existing conditions recorded are general vehicular travel including pickupdropoff operations school bus parking transit pedestrian and bicycle behaviors To aid this process a safety audit with an emphasis on walking was performed The audit encompasses positive and negative experiences during field visits from a professional civil engineering perspective as well as an end user of the facilities Walkability accessibility visibility and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists are some of the major concerns that were evaluated in the audit A followup interview regarding access egress and circulation at the school was conducted with Lincoln HS Principal Jose Torres on May This report concludes with observed deficiencies major operational andor circulation issues and offers potential opportunities for improvements to site access andor onsite circulation at Lincoln HS that can be explored further in the facilities planning process for the Lincoln HS Comprehensive Modernization Project as well as other future projects Appendix A includes notes from the field review conducted on April and Appendix B includes notes from the walk audits conducted on the same date Selected photos depicting conditions described in this report are included in Appendix C Appendix D provides additional information on circulation such as traffic counts on record School and Neighborhood Description The Lincoln HS campus is located in the

stops and services operators and routes provided adjacent to Lincoln HS are as follows North Broadway o Northwest corner of Thomas Street Metro westbound Metro westbound LADOT DASH Lincoln HeightsChinatown westbound o Southwest corner of Lincoln Park Avenue LADOT DASH Lincoln HeightsChinatown eastbound Lincoln Park Avenue o Southeast corner of Altura Street Metro northbound o Southwest corner of Altura Street Metro southbound Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities There are no bicycle facilities located within the school zone No bicycle racks are provided on school grounds In the Mobility Plan Lincoln Park Avenue is listed as part of the Neighborhood Enhanced Network which are slowmoving locallyserving streets that promote safety of all roadway users and North Broadway is listed as part of the proposed Bicycle Lane Network a network of arterial streets prioritizing bicycle movement within the school zone Sidewalks exist on both sides of North Broadway Thomas Street and Lincoln Park Avenue within the school zone Sideways terminate on Thomas Street north of Alta Street A sidewalk exists on the south side of Alta Street Altura Street does not contain any sidewalks In the Mobility Plan North Broadway is listed as a Pedestrian Enhanced District which are areas where pedestrian improvements are prioritized relative to other modes within the school zone According to the interview of Lincoln HS Principal Jose Torres only to students and faculty bike to Lincoln HS regularly Because there are no bicycle racks on campus bicycles are locked in miscellaneous locations throughout Lincoln HS Mr Torres also noted that they have several students from the surrounding neighborhood who walk to school LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report Parks and Other Recreational Facilities Lincoln Park is approximately mile south of Lincoln HS Lincoln Heights Youth Center and Lincoln Heights Recreation Center are both approximately mile west of Lincoln HS Ela Park is approximately mile northwest of Lincoln HS Ascot Hills Park is approximately east of Lincoln HS Congestion Location Observations During the morning drop off period queues were observed for the eastbound left turn from North Broadway to Lincoln Park Avenue Southbound right turning vehicles and parents dropping off students along Lincoln Park Avenue were observed to frequently block through vehicles General congestion occurs during the morning and afternoon bell periods due to the number of parents who pickup or dropoff students at various undesignated locations surrounding the campus Appendix D contains traffic counts that were obtained from the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation LADOT NavigateLA database SCHOOL OPERATIONS Parking At the Lincoln HS main campus there are two main parking lots with miscellaneous other smaller parking areas The main facultyvisitor lot that runs through Altura Street private contains marked spaces including vanaccessible spaces There are two unmarked areas in this parking lot which can accommodate approximately vehicles These areas had been occupied by temporary modular units until recently A facultyonly lot with access from the south side of Altura Street private contains spaces including standard vehicleaccessible space Among several miscellaneous unmarked parking areas a small parking area exists on the west side of Lincoln Park Avenue which accommodates marked van accessible space No signage exists to indicate that any of these lots are available for visitors At the Lincoln HS east campus and football field three unmarked parking areas exist These are generally only accessible during football games and do not appear to be utilized during the school day One lot can be accessed via a gated entrance public portion of Altura Street off Lincoln Park Avenue Two other lots can be accessed by using a gated entrance off of North Broadway LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report Both students and faculty utilize available curb parking particularly faculty along Alta Street Lincoln HS administration stated that parking utilization had been very high when enrollment was closer to students and mobile classrooms were onsite Circulation Lincoln HS administration indicated that most vehicular traffic to or from the school travels from Lincoln Park Avenue south from North Broadway east or west or cuts through the neighborhoods from the north or south There are no designated or signed pickupdropoff areas Therefore parents use whatever space is available although major patterns exist Parents drive north on Thomas Street northeast on Alta Street through Altura Street private and use all three streets for pick updropoffs Parents also use the west curb of Lincoln Park Avenue for pickupdropoffs many of whom drive northbound on Lincoln Park Avenue and then illegally Uturn southbound The north side of North Broadway east of Lincoln Park Avenue is also used for pickupdropoffs During the afternoon bell period many students board Metro buses on Broadway mostly in the westbound direction As a result of more students taking Metro buses to get home than taking Metro buses to get to school there are fewer pickups during the afternoon bell period than dropoffs in the morning bell period Although no stopping is permitted on the north side of North Broadway immediately before and after school hours school bus loading and unloading occurs in this location as well as parent pickupdropoffs Some of these vehicles were observed to occasionally block public transit buses and even block crosswalks or park on top of curb ramps Flexible posts and bollards are installed on the northwest and southwest corners of North Broadway and Lincoln Park Avenue to discourage driving onto sidewalks or in parking areas Since Lincoln HS is a closed campus several gates restrict access and are opened only for morning and afternoon bell periods with a side entrance near the southwest corner of Lincoln Park Avenue and North Broadway being the only way to enter or exit the site during school hours Most students enter the main campus by walking into and through the main parking lot the main gate on North Broadway between Thomas Street and Lincoln Park Avenue or a side gate approximately halfway along Alta Street No crossing guards are deployed at Lincoln HS Students generally egress using similar routes The majority of students use the main gate to North Broadway in the afternoon Several students were observed to cross North Broadway LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report midblock which does not contain a marked crosswalk Some students walk to afterschool programs at surrounding facilities Lincoln HS only uses school buses for special education magnet school transfers and for a specific residential area All school buses use the north side of North Broadway for loading and unloading Crash History Crash data used for the Vision Zero project was extracted within the Lincoln HS school zone Between and a total of crashes occurred Eighteen of these crashes were near the intersection of North Broadway and Lincoln Park Avenue Five of these occurred at the intersection of North Broadway and Thomas Street One collision occurred at the intersection of Thomas Street and Alta Street One collision occurred midblock along North Broadway between Thomas Street and Lincoln Park Avenue Within the school zone pedestrian collisions and bicycle collision were recorded all of which resulted in nonsevere injuries No fatalities and severe injuries were recorded Most collisions were rear end broadside or sideswipes Based on the available data no discernible collision patterns were noted However the number of total crashes and severe injury crashes and within a year period respectively at the intersection of Lincoln Park Avenue and North Broadway as compared to the volumes entering the intersection may indicate physical conditions that are not readily apparent to the driver DEFICIENCIES AND OPPORTUNITIES Walk Audit Observations Internal student circulation within the Lincoln HS campus appears to be generally sufficient with some notable exceptions An ADA path of travel is marked on the campus leading from the main parking lot and internal parking lots although a steep grade exists between the two lots that may be difficult to use for people with disabilities Additionally students walk through the main parking lot and are not separated from vehicular traffic Students connect between campuses via a gradeseparated pedestrian bridge over Lincoln Park Avenue This is the only nonemergency accessegress point for the classroom building on the east campus While a long sloped ramp and staircase exists from the surface streets to the east campus these appear to be seldom used LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report The following observations were collected during an external walk audit conducted on April on the streets surrounding the campus These streets are under the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles and revealed the following deficiencies Lincoln Park Avenue o Sidewalks are generally uneven cracked may be difficult to traverse in a wheelchair o Numerous steep and unmaintained driveway curb cuts make it difficult for pedestrians to use the sidewalks o Conflicts with bicyclists observed on sidewalks o No curb ramps at Altura Street near main facultyvisitor parking lot may be difficult to traverse in a wheelchair o Tactile strips for all curb ramps are absent may be difficult for visionimpaired students o Parkedstopped vehicles observed blocking curb ramps and crosswalks o No transit shelters or benches Thomas Street o Sidewalks are generally uneven cracked may be difficult to traverse in a wheelchair and overgrown brush makes some sections unusable o No street lighting observed may affect morning circulation during winter months o Worn pavement markings o Tactile strips for all curb ramps are absent may be difficult for visionimpaired students North Broadway o Conflicts with bicyclists observed on sidewalks o No transit shelters o Signing and pavement markings prohibit the current school bus operation o No benches available for school bus loading area o Tactile strips for all curb ramps are absent may be difficult for visionimpaired students Additional detail from the walk audit is provided in Appendix B Selected photos for major deficiencies prompted by the walk audit are provided in Appendix C LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS Site Circulation Report Observed Circulation Deficiencies PickupDropoffs o Use of Altura Street private blocks entryexit from parking lot o Use of west side of Lincoln Park Avenue interferes with cafeteria deliveries and also prevents use of a vanaccessible ADA parking spot Circulation o Vehicular circulation was observed to be congested at North Broadway and Lincoln Park intersection particularly in the AM peak period o Pedestrians crossing midblock between Lincoln Park Avenue and Thomas Street o Abutting sidewalks are uneven and contain vegetation overgrowth Positive Attributes While some vertical grades are steep campus buildings appear to be built on varying elevations which may help reduce the need for expensive accessibility circulation upgrades since improvements such as curb ramps can be constructed in lieu of building retrofits Opportunities The following opportunities are not required improvements and are not required to limit or mitigate potential impacts This list is provided solely as observations to LAUSD of the existing conditions that were observed during a site visit for planning purposes The feasibility or practicality of these opportunities have not been evaluated and LAUSD does not have jurisdiction over any offsite improvements Underutilized parking areas by visitors on east campus during school hours While offsite improvements are not within LAUSDs jurisdiction Thomas StreetAlta StreetAltura Street provides a natural circulation route that is clockwise and predominantly involves right turns and does not abut residences While offsite improvements are not within LAUSDs jurisdiction the installation of offsite wayfinding signage may help to organize circulation While offsite improvements are not within LAUSDs jurisdiction signagemarkings for school buses on North Broadway should be updated to reflect school bus operation LIN Consulting Inc LAUSD Comprehensive Modernization Project Abraham Lincoln HS

Angeles Los Angeles County California Comprehensive modernization projects are designed to address the most critical physical needs of the building and grounds at school sites through building replacement renovation modernization and reconfiguration The proposed Lincoln HS Comprehensive Modernization Project Project is required to undergo an environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA This Initial Study provides an evaluation of the potential environmental consequences associated with this proposed Project BACKGROUND On July the LAUSD Board of Education BOE adopted a Resolution Ordering an Election and Establishing Specifications of the Election Order for the purpose of placing Measure Q a billion bond measure on the November election ballot to fund the renovation modernization construction and expansion of school facilities On November the bond passed The nationwide economic downturn in resulted in a decline in assessed valuation of real property which restricted the Districts ability to issue Measure Q bonds and the remaining unissued Measures R and Y funds Once assessed valuation improved the BOE could authorize the issuance of bond funds On December the District refined their School Upgrade Program SUP to reflect the intent and objectives of Measure Q as well as the updated needs of District school facilities and educational goals Between July and November the SUP was analyzed under CEQA criteria in a Program Environmental Impact Report Program EIR On November the BOE certified the Final SUP Program EIR On December the BOE approved the project definition for the Lincoln HS proposed Project to provide facilities that are safe secure and better aligned with the current instructional program The proposed Project is designed to address the most critical physical concerns of the building and grounds at the Campus while providing renovations modernizations and reconfiguration as needed LAUSD Board of

compliance process is governed by the CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines CEQA was enacted in by the California Legislature to disclose to decisionmakers and the public the significant environmental effects of projects and to identify ways to avoid or reduce the environmental effects through feasible alternatives or mitigation measures Compliance with CEQA applies to California government agencies at all levels local regional and State agencies boards commissions and special districts such as school districts and water districts LAUSD is the lead agency for this proposed Project and is therefore required to conduct an environmental review to analyze the potential environmental effects associated with the proposed Project California Public Resources Code PRC Section a states that analysis of a projects environmental impact is required for any discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies In this case LAUSD has determined that an initial study is required to determine whether there is substantial evidence that construction and operation of the proposed Project would result in environmental impacts An initial study is a preliminary environmental analysis to determine whether an environmental impact report EIR a mitigated negative declaration MND or a negative declaration ND is required for a project When an initial study identifies the potential for significant environmental impacts the lead agency must prepare an EIR however if all impacts are found to be lessthansignificant or can be mitigated to a lessthan significant level the lead agency can prepare a ND or MND that incorporates mitigation measures into the project ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS A project means the whole of an action that has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment and that is any of the following An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land improvements to existing public structures enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances and the adoption and amendment of local General Plans or elements thereof pursuant to Government Code Sections An activity undertaken by a person which is supported in whole or in part through public agency contacts grants subsidies loans or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease permit license certificate or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies California Public Resources Code et seq California Code of Regulations Title Division Chapter et seq California Code of

constitute a project because the activity would result in a direct physical change in the environment and would be undertaken by a public agency All projects in the State of California are required to undergo an environmental review to determine the environmental impacts associated with implementation of the project Initial Study This Initial Study was prepared in accordance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines as amended to determine if the Project could have a significant impact on the environment The purposes of this Initial Study as described in the State CEQA Guidelines Section are to provide the lead agency with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an EIR or ND enable the lead agency to modify a project mitigating adverse impacts before an EIR is prepared thereby enabling the project to qualify for a negative declaration assist the preparation of an EIR if one is required facilitate environmental assessment early in the design of a project provide documentation of the factual basis for the finding in an ND that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment eliminate unnecessary EIRs and determine whether a previously prepared EIR could be used with the project The findings in this Initial Study have determined that an MND is the appropriate level of environmental documentation for this Project Environmental Impact Report The MND includes information necessary for agencies to meet statutory responsibilities related to the proposed Project State and local agencies will use the MND when considering any permit or other approvals necessary to implement the project A preliminary list of the environmental topics that have been identified for study in the MND is provided in the Initial Study Checklist Chapter Following consideration of any public comments on the Initial Study the Draft EIR will be completed and then circulated to the public and affected agencies for review and comment One of the primary objectives of CEQA is to enhance public participation in the planning process public involvement is an essential feature of CEQA Community members are encouraged to participate in the environmental review process request to be notified monitor newspapers for formal announcements and submit substantive comments at every possible opportunity afforded by the District The environmental review process provides several opportunities for the public to participate through public notice and public review of CEQA documents and public meetings Additionally LAUSD is required to consider comments from the scoping process in the preparation of the Draft EIR and to respond to Draft EIR public comments in the Final EIR Tiering This type of project is one of many that were analyzed in the LAUSD SUP Program EIR that was certified by the LAUSD BOE on November LAUSDs SUP Program EIR meets the criteria for a Program EIR under CEQA Guidelines Section a as one prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large project and are related[a]s individual activities carried out under the same authorizing statutory Program EIR for the School Upgrade Program httpachievelausdnetceqa Los

Introduction or regulatory authority and having generally similar environmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways The Program EIR enables LAUSD to streamline future environmental compliance and reduces the need for repetitive environmental studies The Program EIR serves as the framework and baseline for CEQA analyses of later projects through a process known as tiering Under CEQA Guidelines Sections a and Tiering refers to using the analysis of general matters contained in a broader EIR such as one prepared for a program with later EIRs and negative declarations on narrower projects incorporating by reference the general discussions from the broader EIR and concentrating the later EIR or negative declaration solely on the issues specific to the later project The Program EIR is applicable to all projects implemented under the SUP The Program EIR provides the framework for evaluating environmental impacts related to ongoing facility upgrade projects planned by the District Due to the extensive number of individual projects anticipated to occur under the SUP projects were grouped into four categories based on the amount and type of construction proposed The four categories of projects are as follows Type New Construction on New Property Type New Construction on Existing Campus Type Modernization Repair Replacement Upgrade Remodel Renovation and Installation Type Operational and Other Campus Changes The proposed Project is categorized as Type New Construction on Existing Campus which includes demolition and new building construction on existing campuses and the replacement of school buildings on the same location and Type Modernization Repair Replacement Upgrade Remodel Renovation and Installation which includes modernization and infrastructure upgrades The evaluation of environmental impacts related to Type and Type projects and the appropriate project design features and mitigation measures to incorporate are provided in the Program EIR The proposed Project is considered a sitespecific project under the Program EIR therefore this MND is tiered from the SUP Program EIR The Program EIR is available for review online at httpachievelausdnetceqa and at LAUSDs Office of Environmental Health and Safety South Beaudry Avenue st Floor Los Angeles Project Plan and Building Design The Project is subject to the California Department of Education CDE design and siting requirements and the school architectural designs are subject to review and approval by the California Division of the State Architect DSA The proposed

environmentally responsible costeffective healthier places to live and work reduce energy and water consumption and respond to the environmental directives of the Department of Housing and Community Development Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects SCs were adopted by the BOE on February Board Report Number SCs are environmental standards that are applied to District construction upgrade and improvement projects during the environmental review process by the OEHS California Environmental Quality Act CEQA team to offset potential environmental impacts The SCs were largely compiled from established LAUSD standards guidelines specifications practices plans policies and programs For each SC applicability is triggered by factors such as the project type and existing conditions These SCs are implemented during the planning construction and operational phases of the projects The Board of Education adopted a previous version of the SCs on November Board Report Number They were originally compiled as a supplement to the Program Environmental Impact Report Program EIR for the School Upgrade Program which was certified by the BOE on November also Board Report No The most recently adopted SCs were updated in order to incorporate and reflect recent changes in the laws regulations and the Districts standard policies practices and specifications eg the Design Guidelines and Design Standards which are routinely

protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and SCs there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs The specific CHPS prerequisite criteria and LAUSD SCs are identified in the tables under each CEQA topic Federal state regional and local laws regulations plans and guidelines CHPS criteria PDFs and SCs are considered part of the Project and are included in the environmental analysis IMPACT TERMINOLOGY The following terminology is used to describe the level of significance of impacts A finding of no impact is appropriate if the analysis concludes that the Project would not affect the particular topic area in any way An impact is considered less than significant if the analysis concludes that it would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment and requires no mitigation An impact is considered less than significant with mitigation incorporated if the analysis concludes that it would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment with the inclusion of environmental commitments or other enforceable mitigation measures CHPS criteria are summarized The full requirement can be found at httpwwwchpsnetdevDrupalCalifornia Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R

commercial uses surround the immediate vicinity of Lincoln HS CAMPUS HISTORY The following Campus history summary is from the Lincoln HS Historic Resource Assessment Report prepared for Lincoln HS Please refer to the complete report provided in Appendix A for a detailed history Early History Lincoln HS is one of the five oldest high schools in the City of Los Angeles It was constructed in and designed by architecture firm Needham and Cline at the northeast corner of what is now North Broadway and Lincoln Park Avenue in Lincoln Heights The original school was at this location until the Long Beach earthquake of which resulted in extensive damage to the Campus The school was reconstructed by the Public Works Administration PWA in and most of the Campus buildings that survived the quake were demolished during the rebuild The portions of the Campus that remained include the main stairway walkway tennis courts and palm trees The new Campus was built in one block west of Lincoln Park Avenue and contained three main buildings oriented around a central landscaped courtyard off North Broadway the administration Science and Classroom Building now the Administration Building the Commerce Home Economics and Cafeteria Building now the Home Economics Building and the Assembly and Music Building now the Auditorium Building All of these buildings were designed in the popular PWA Moderne style The new Campus opened in September The Gymnasium was completed in The Campus continued to be altered in the postWorld War II years By all of the buildings from the original Campus referenced herein as the eastern parcel had been demolished and replaced with the athletic field running track and bleachers A music building was added in By a pedestrian bridge had been erected over Lincoln Park Avenue linking the schools eastern parcel to Mechanical Arts Building No on the western parcel In the s and s a number of portable classroom buildings were added and in a new music building was constructed Additional classrooms were added in and during the s including the New Ceramics and Mechanical Arts Building now the Shop Building and a new pedestrian bridge over Lincoln Park Avenue was built By the northernmost part of the Campus on the western parcel was occupied by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation High School formerly Lincoln Continuation High School The Campus continued to change in recent years including repair of buildings after the Northridge Earthquake a Campus modernization project and addition of four elevator towers original window replacement inkind at the Administration Home Economics and Auditorium buildings a reconfiguration of areas to create parking lots and landscape features and replacement of original pedestrian bridges with steel bridges

BACKGROUND The Comprehensive Modernization Projects are intended to plan and complete largescale improvements to select LAUSD campuses to address buildings and grounds in the greatest need of upgrades The proposed comprehensive modernization projects will address the most critical physical conditions and essential safety issues This will be achieved by modernizing repairing reconfiguring andor replacing existing buildings constructing new buildings and upgrading deteriorated and outdated site infrastructure Projects will address seismic vulnerabilities failing or broken building and site systems infrastructure and components barriers to program accessibility deteriorated exterior conditions and interior classroom spaces The projects will also significantly reduce the Districts reliance on relocatable buildings Emphasis is placed on seismic safety and failed building systems and components The projects are comprehensive in nature addressing not only the critical physical conditions of a building but also improving the facilities to support the educational program While the projects are comprehensive in nature less critical items are not addressed This approach allows the District to reach more schools with the limited funding available PROPOSED PROJECT LAUSD proposes to complete a Comprehensive Modernization Project at Lincoln HS in an effort to provide facilities that are safe secure and aligned with the instructional program The planned enrollment for Lincoln High School is students and no increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project On December the Board approved the Project definition for Lincoln HS The Project is designed to address the most critical physical concerns of the building and grounds at the Campus while providing renovations modernizations and reconfigurations A Conceptual Site Plan is provided as Figure LAUSD Board of Education LAUSD Board of Education Report File Rep Version December October Page L I N C O L

Mandatory Findings of Population Housing Significance Greenhouse Gas Emissions Public Services None None with Mitigation Incorporated DETERMINATION On the basis of this initial evaluation I find that the proposed project could not have a significant effect on the environment and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment there will not be a significant effect in this case because revisions on the project have been made by or agreed to by the project proponent A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared I find the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment and an ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required I find that the proposed project MAY have a potentially significant impact or potentially significant unless mitigated impact on the environment but at least one effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards and has been addressed by mitigation measures based on earlier analysis as described on attached sheets An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required but it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment because all potentially significant effects a have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards and b have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon the proposed project nothing further is required Signature Carlos A Torres Printed Name October Date CEQA Officer for LAUSD Title Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E

explanation is required for all answers except No Impact answers that are adequately supported by the information sources a lead agency cites in the parentheses following each question A No Impact answer is adequately supported if the referenced information sources show that the impact simply does not apply to projects like the one involved eg the project falls outside a fault rupture zone A No Impact answer should be explained where it is based on projectspecific factors as well as general standards eg the project will not expose sensitive receptors to pollutants based on a projectspecific screening analysis All answers must take account of the whole action involved including offsite as well as onsite cumulative as well as projectlevel indirect as well as direct and construction as well as operational impacts Once the lead agency has determined that a particular physical impact may occur then the checklist answers must indicate whether the impact is potentially significant less than significant with mitigation or less than significant Potentially Significant Impact is appropriate if there is substantial evidence that an effect may be significant If there are one or more Potentially Significant Impact entries when the determination is made an EIR is required Negative Declaration Less Than Significant With Mitigation Incorporated applies where the incorporation of mitigation measures has reduced an effect from Potentially Significant Impact to a Less Than Significant Impact The lead agency must describe the mitigation measures and briefly explain how they reduce the effect to a less than significant level mitigation measures from Earlier Analyses as described in below may be crossreferenced Earlier analyses may be used where pursuant to the tiering program EIR or other CEQA process an effect has been adequately analyzed in an earlier EIR or negative declaration Section cD In this case a brief discussion should identify the following a Earlier Analysis Used Identify and state where they are available for review b Impacts Adequately Addressed Identify which effects from the above checklist were within the scope of and adequately analyzed in an earlier document pursuant to applicable legal standards and state whether such effects were addressed by mitigation measures based on the earlier analysis c Mitigation Measures For effects that are Less than Significant with Mitigation Measures Incorporated describe the mitigation measures which were incorporated or refined from the earlier document and the extent to which they address sitespecific conditions for the project Lead agencies are encouraged to incorporate into the checklist references to information sources for potential impacts eg general plans zoning ordinances Reference to a previously prepared or outside document should where appropriate include a reference to the page or pages where the statement is substantiated Supporting Information Sources A source

the Illuminating Engineering Society IES Model Lighting Ordinance MLO shall be used as a guide for environmentally responsible outdoor lighting The MLO has outdoor lighting standards that reduce glare light trespass and skyglow The MLO uses lighting zones LZ to which allow the District to vary the lighting restrictions according to the sensitivity of the community The MLO also incorporates the BacklightUplightGlare BUG rating system for luminaires which provides more effective control of unwanted light The MLO establishes standards to Limit the amount of light that can be used Minimize glare by controlling the amount of light that tends to create glare Minimize sky glow by controlling the amount of uplight Minimize the amount of offsite impacts or light trespass a Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista Less Than Significant Impact The Program EIR states that all SUPrelated projects would not have a substantial adverse effect on scenic vistas and that as a rule existing established public schools tend to be aesthetically compatible with the neighborhoods within which they are located and their scope height and mass unlikely to block obscure or degrade surrounding views Scenic views are typically defined as those that provide expansive views of a highlyvalued landscape for the benefit of the general public Panoramic views are usually associated with vantage points looking out over a section of urban or natural areas that provide a geographic orientation not commonly available While the design of the Project was not completed at the time of the preparation of this Initial Study implementation of the proposed Project is not anticipated to substantially alter distant views of the surrounding environment in comparison to existing conditions The Project site is located within the community of Lincoln Heights in an urban area surrounded by single and multifamily residential and limited commercial uses During the June site visit no distant mountain views were observed from the Campus Therefore the Project impacts on scenic vistas would be less than significant and no further analysis is required b Substantially damage scenic resources

element of the General Plan Lincoln Boulevard Highway Route is a State Scenic Highway starting at the intersection of Venice Boulevard which is approximately miles southwest of the project site No impacts to scenic resources along a designated scenic highway would result and no further analysis is required c In nonurbanized areas substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of public views of the site and its surroundings Public views are those that are experienced from publicly accessible vantage points If the project is in an urbanized area would the project conflict with applicable zoning and other regulations governing scenic quality Less Than Significant Visual quality is a measure of the overall impression or appeal of an area as determined by the particular landscapes characteristics and scenic resources eg mountains ocean etc It is possible for new structures to be compatible with the existing setting if they replicate existing forms lines colors and textures of the surrounding environment and if the new structures do not appreciably change the balance of natural elements In summary visual quality is concerned with the overall attractiveness of an area and the ability to preserve this attractiveness when new features are introduced Lincoln HS is located in the community of Lincoln Heights Situated just across the Los Angeles River and east of downtown Los Angeles Lincoln Heights is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city Overwhelmingly residential much of the neighborhood occupies hilly topography Neighborhood streets are populated primarily with earlyth century residences along with some lateth century homes and more recent multifamily residential infill Commercial streets are lined with modest mostly onestory retail storefronts and service buildings with some twostory commercial blocks at larger intersections Neighborhood landmarks include Lincoln Park the San Antonio Winery and the Brewery Art Colony The visual setting of the area is generally urbanized Surrounding visual elements include single and multi family residential and limited commercial uses surrounded the immediate vicinity of Lincoln HS Construction Evaluation of construction impacts focuses on the shortterm visual impacts resulting from the demolition and removal of current buildings construction of the proposed Project as well as the presence of equipment and material storage In a visual sense construction impacts from the proposed Project could be obtrusive or out of character with the surrounding landscape Construction equipment and materials exposed dirt and unfinished buildings would temporarily impact the visual character of the Project site Construction is a shortterm impact and construction fencing would be provided around any active construction and staging areas for both screening and security With implementation of SCAE and SC AE impacts to the visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings would be less than significant and no further evaluation is required City of Los Angeles Mobility Plan an Element of the General Plan adopted by City Planning Commission on June and City

on Campus and the creation of a new permanent classroom buildings modernization of existing facilities new landscape and exterior paint that would provide beneficial longterm visual impacts to the area LAUSD requires the consideration of architectural appearancecompatibility as well as other aesthetic factors during the preliminary design review The Program EIR states that all SUPrelated projects would not substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings For construction of new buildings SCAE requires that architectural quality consider compatibility with the surrounding community SCAE incorporates reviews by LAUSD to ensure that methods from the current School Design Guide are incorporated throughout the planning design construction and operation of the Project SCAE requires analysis of views and consistency with the general character of the surrounding neighborhood SCAE requires LAUSD to review all designs and test new lights following installation to ensure that adverse light trespass and glare impacts are avoided Therefore with implementation of the required measures from the LAUSD School Design Guide and SCAE SCAE SCAE and SCAE Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required d Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area Less than Significant The two major causes of light pollution are glare and spill light Spill light is caused by misdirected light that illuminates areas outside the area intended to be lit Glare occurs when a bright object is against a dark background such as oncoming vehicle headlights or an unshielded light bulb Lincoln HS is located within a developed urban environment The existing Campus generates nighttime light from security lighting including parking lot and building lights interior and exterior and from field lights Surrounding land uses also generate significant light from street lights vehicle lights parking lot lights and building lights The Project would not significantly increase nighttime lighting on the Campus since new buildings would replace existing buildings and portable classrooms Furthermore the Project does not include any new sources of highintensity lighting such as field lights Nighttime illumination would be designed arranged directed or shielded in accordance with existing applicable regulations and guidelines for school operations With respect to all SUP projects the Program EIR states SUPrelated projects would not generate substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime views Therefore with implementation of the required measures from the LAUSD School Design Guide and SCs AE AE and AE light and glare impacts

Prepare and implement a trip reduction plan for construction employees Implement a shuttle service to and from retail services and food establishments during lunch hours Increase distance between emission sources to reduce nearfield emission impacts Pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of the USEPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment The NAAQS are classified as primary and secondary standards Primary standards prescribe the maximum permissible concentration in the ambient air and are required to protect public health Secondary standards specify levels of air quality required to protect public welfare including materials soils vegetation and wildlife from any known or anticipated adverse effects NAAQS are established for six pollutants known as criteria pollutants ozone O particle pollution ie respirable particulate matter less than microns in diameter [PM] and respirable particulate matter less than microns in diameter [PM] carbon monoxide CO nitrogen dioxide NO sulfur dioxide SO and lead Pb The California Air Resources Board CARB has also established its own air quality standards in the state of California known as the California Ambient Air Quality Standards CAAQS The CAAQS are generally more stringent than the NAAQS and include air quality standards for all the criteria pollutants listed under NAAQS plus sulfates SO hydrogen sulfide HS vinyl chloride and visibilityreducing particulate matter The USEPA classifies the air quality within an Air Quality Control Region with regard to its attainment of federal primary and secondary NAAQS An area with air quality better than the NAAQS for a specific pollutant is designated as being in attainment for that pollutant Any area not meeting the NAAQS is classified as a nonattainment area Where there is a lack of data for the USEPA to make a determination regarding attainment or nonattainment the area is designated as unclassified and is treated as an attainment area until proven otherwise Similarly the CARB makes state area designations for the state criteria pollutants The proposed Project is in the City of Los Angeles within Los Angeles County which is subject to the South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD regulations Pollutant concentrations within the Los Angeles County are

violations or delay the timely attainment of air quality standards or the interim emissions reductions specified in the AQMP The Project will not exceed the assumptions in the AQMP or increments based on the year of Project buildout ie The Project is not intended to increase student population and its overall building square footage would decrease Thus the Project would not result in an increase of operations Since the overall building footprint will decrease operations would likely reduce as well ie less energy water and upkeep efforts would be required to run the resulting building structures Additionally the Project would be consistent with the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan which is the element of the General Plan of the City of Los Angeles and the area under which the Project is located The project site is within the SCAQMD which oversees the welfare of air quality in the portion of Los Angeles County where the proposed Project is located The SCAQMD promotes air quality improvement though air quality monitoring evaluation education implementation of control measures to reduce emissions from stationary sources permitting and inspection of pollution sources enforcement of air quality regulations and support and implementation of measures to reduce emissions from motor vehicles The federal CAA requires states to develop plans known as State Implementation Plans SIPs stating how they will attain or maintain NAAQS SIPs are a compilation of new and previously approved plans programs district rules state regulations and federal controls States and local air quality management agencies prepare SIPs for approval by the USEPA To this end the SCAQMD in conjunction with the California Air Resources Board the Southern California Association of Governments SCAG and the USEPA have prepared the Final Air Quality Management Plan AQMP or Plan to ensure continued progress toward clean air and reach federal and state compliance requirements over the next two decades The AQMP incorporates emissions projections based on growth forecasts accounted for in local and regional general plans Local governments maintain the authority to determine the types of land use that are allowed within their jurisdiction For example in city general plans each parcel of land within that city is given a land use designation ie residential industrial etc Developments that do not comply with general plan designations are inconsistent with the general plan A proposed Project that is inconsistent with a local general plan is also inconsistent with the AQMP Project emissions would occur during the construction of the Project Project construction emissions would contribute to emissions emitted in the County of Los Angeles To determine their significance Project construction emissions were calculated using the California Emissions Estimator Model CalEEMod CalEEMod is widely accepted to provide a uniform platform to estimate potential emissions resulting from construction and operation activities of land use projects The model uses preprogramed algorithms to calculate emissions based on data entered The algorithms are designed to take information such as project size construction length vehicle and equipment types number of vehicle trips and lengths and equipment operating hours to calculate emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases Emission

federal or state ambient air quality standard Less Than Significant Impact Shortterm ie construction air pollutant emissions would potentially occur during site preparation and construction activities associated with the proposed Project Operational emissions are expected to remain at or below current status CEQA defines cumulative impacts as two or more individual effects which when considered together are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts and the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past present or reasonably foreseeable future projects and can result from individually minor but collectively significant project taking place over a period of time The proposed Project would result in cumulative impacts if it exceeded daily thresholds established by SCAQMD or if it incurred an increase of emissions beyond what is planned in the City of Los Angeles General Plan Significance thresholds are established to assist lead agencies in determining whether a project may have a significant air quality impact Projects with emissions below established thresholds will not have a significant impact on air quality Projects with emissions equal to or exceeding the established significance threshold will have a potentially significant adverse impact on air quality Since the proposed Project is within the jurisdiction of the SCAQMD air quality significance thresholds established by the SCAQMD are used as a reference to determine its significance on the environment A summary of construction emissions SCAQMD air quality significance thresholds a comparison of construction emissions versus thresholds and significance statements are presented in Table The proposed Project emissions are below established significant thresholds and therefore it has a less than significant impact and no further analysis is required c Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations Less Than Significant Impact Shortterm air pollutant emissions will occur during site preparation and construction activities associated with the proposed Project but are not anticipated to expose sensitive receptors eg students and school staff who are the primary [ie closest] sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations and would have a less than significant impact The closest offsite sensitive receptors include residences that border the Campus to the north and west and Gates Street Elementary School located southwest of the campus across North Broadway The following sections provide a summary of the assessment performed to arrive at the conclusion that the proposed project has a less than significant impact associated with the exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations and no further analysis is required Construction Localized Significance Thresholds Localized Significance Thresholds LST

Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology document The methodology includes lookup tables with localized significance threshold according to source receptor area for one two and five acre proposed projects emitting CO Nox PM or PM The LST methodology and associated LST mass rates are not designed to evaluate localized impacts from mobile sources traveling over the roadways Thus mobile emissions are not considered to determine localized significance The LST mass rates applicable to the proposed project are based on the Central Los Angeles area which is the source receptor area where the project is located and for a oneacre project size since the footprint of the daily area disturbed is anticipated to be within one acre The LSTs are also based on receptors being within meters from the construction emission sources Maximum daily onsite emissions of all criteria pollutants from all construction phases calculated in CalEEMod are included in appendix A summarized in Table and compared against applicable LSTs from Appendix C of the Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology document Based on this analysis none of the LSTs are exceeded Construction Emission Health Risk Emissions of TACs associated with the proposed Project would be emitted primarily through the combustion of diesel fuel by construction equipment during the construction of the Project These emissions are temporary and will stop once the construction phase is completed The SCAQMD has neither adopted nor recommended methodology for assessing health risk analysis associated with mobile sources at construction sites Operation Localized Significance Thresholds Operation activities of the proposed Project are expected to remain unchanged andor decrease overall emissions of criteria pollutants as a result of a reduction in building footprint Thus a localized significance analysis is not necessary and not further pursued in this document Carbon Monoxide Hotspots Congested intersections have the potential to result in localized high levels of CO which results from incomplete combustion of carbon containing fuels eg gasoline and diesel CO exposure can have a significant impact on sensitive receptors Since operation activities of the proposed Project are expected to remain consistent with the current conditions traffic impacts including increases in CO emissions associated with the proposed Project would not occur Thus a CO analysis to assess new operational CO emissions is not required d Result in other emissions such as those leading to odors adversely

conducted in coordination with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife SCBIO LAUSD shall comply with the following conditions if a new school would be located in an area containing native habitat or if a protected tree would be removed from an existing campus New Construction in Native Habitat LAUSD shall avoid constructing new schools in areas containing mature native protected trees to the extent feasible If site avoidance is not feasible individual trees should be protected If protected trees may be impacted the following conditions may be required Translocation of rare plants is prohibited in most instances CDFW in most cases does not recommend translocation salvage andor transplantation of rare threatened or endangered plant species in particular oak trees as compensation for adverse effects because successful implementation of translocation is rare Even if translocation is initially successful it will typically fail to persist over time Permanent conservation of habitat To ensure the conservation of sensitive plant species the preferred method is permanent conservation of habitat containing these species any translocation proposed shall only be an experimental component of a larger more robust plan Offsite acquisition of woodland habitat Due to the inherent difficulty in creating functional woodland habitat with associated understory components the preferred method is offsite acquisition of woodland habitat in the local area All acquired habitat shall be protected under a conservation easement and deeded to a local land conservancy for management and protection Creation of woodlands Any creation of functioning woodlands shall be of similar composition structure and function of the affected woodland The new woodland shall mimic the function demonstrate recruitment plant density canopy and vegetation cover as well as other measurable success criteria before the measure is deemed a success o All seed and shrub sources used for tree and understory species in the new planting site shall be collected or grown from onsite sources or from adjacent areas and may be purchased from a supplier that specializes in native seed collection and propagation This method should reduce the risk of introducing diseases and pathogens into areas where they might not currently exist o Woodland species should be replaced by planting seeds Monitoring efforts including the exclusion of herbivores shall be employed to maximize seedling survival during the monitoring period o Monitoring period for woodlands shall be at least years with a minimum of years without supplemental irrigation This allows the trees to go through one typical drought cycle This should also be the minimal time needed to see signs of stress and disease and determine the need for replacement plantings LAUSD shall request CDFW review and comment on any translocation plans habitat preservation habitat creation andor restoration plans Removal of Protected

utilize buildingsurban vegetation Table Due to the developed nature of the Project site the plant list established during the general biological survey and the tree species reported on the Arborist Report it has been determined that there is no potential for special status plant species to occur on site There are no native vegetation communities on site With the exception of the American peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus anatum which is considered tolerant of urban environments all wildlife species included in Table have a low potential to occur The preferred native vegetation communities of the Swainsons hawk Buteo swainsoni are not present on or within the vicinity of the site The four bat species included in Table pallid bat [Antrozous pallidus] Townsends bigeared bat [Corynorhinus townsendii] western mastiff bat [Eumops perotis californicus] and western red bat [Lasiurus blossevillii] could potentially roost in buildings or surrounding trees however there is high human activity on and adjacent to the Project site therefore any potential bat roosting sites are likely disturbed frequently and the potential for protected bat species to occur on site is low Nonnative grasslands scrublands and ruderal spaces can be considered suitable habitat for burrowing owl Athene cunicularia dependent upon the presence of burrowing mammals or suitable surrogate burrows non native grassland is adjacent to the northeast portion of the Project site There is one CNDDB documented burrowing owl occurrence from the year within miles of the Project site the exact location is not known No burrows sedentary above ground pipes sedentary rip rap etc that could serve as suitable burrow habitat for burrowing owl were observed on site during the biological survey The nonnative grassland adjacent to the northeast portion of the Project site is considered poor quality habitat this area is densely vegetated with nonnative grasses and the trees and shrubs present are primarily escaped ornamentals Minimal open ground was observed within this area Therefore the potential for burrowing owl to occur on the Project site is low Aside from the species presented in Table while unlikely special status bird species that do not necessarily have documented regional occurrences near the Project site could also occur These species would be considered transients and would not be expected to have long term use of the site While vegetated areas are present on and adjacent to the Project site the species observed include primarily nonnatives and are ornamental in nature The native plant species observed on site include coast live oak Quercus agrifolia western sycamore Platanus racemosa California fan palm Washingtonia filifera California black walnut Juglans californica blue elderberry Sambucus nigra and toyon Heteromeles arbutifolia Native plant species observed consisted of isolated individuals therefore did not make up a native vegetation community Native wildlife species observed on site during the biological survey included house finch Haemorhous mexicanus cabbage white Pieris rapae black phoebe Sayornis nigricans Annas hummingbird Calypte anna hooded oriole Icterus cucullatus mourning dove Zenaida macroura Cassins kingbird Tyrannus vociferans California ground squirrel Spermophilus beecheyi western fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis and native mourning cloak Nymphalis antiopa Nonnative wildlife species observed on site during the biological survey included house sparrow Passer domesticus rock pigeon Columba livia and European starling Sturnus vulgaris Vegetation and structures within and surrounding the Project site could support bird nesting and bat roosting activity Multiple active house finch nests were observed in the

the CRZ The CRZ is commonly defined as a circular area around a tree truck with a radius equivalent to one foot for each inch of diameter at breast height DBH Protection of the CRZ of oaks is particularly important as compaction of soil can create anaerobic conditions that slowly suffocate mycorrhizal fungi that oak trees rely on to fixate nitrogen The LAUSD OEHS Tree Trimming and Removal Procedure requires that after completing the Project design results of the tree inventory will be used to determine impacts to trees located within the work area A Tree Impact Report will be required

and was designed by architecture firm Needham and Cline at the northeast corner of what is now North Broadway and Lincoln Park Avenue in the Lincoln Heights community The original school was at this location until the Long Beach earthquake of which resulted in extensive damage to the Campus The school was reconstructed by the Public Works Administration PWA in and most of the Campus buildings that survived the quake were demolished during the rebuild The portions of the Campus that remained include the main stairway walkway tennis courts and palm trees The new Campus was built in one block west of Lincoln Park Avenue and contained three main buildings oriented around a central landscaped courtyard off North Broadway the administration Science and Classroom Building now the Administration Building the Commerce Home Economics and Cafeteria Building now the Home Economics Building and the Assembly and Music Building now the Auditorium Building All of these buildings were designed in the popular PWA Moderne style The new Campus opened in September The Gymnasium was completed in Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T I N

buildings from the original Campus referenced herein as the eastern parcel had been demolished and replaced with the athletic field running track and bleachers A music building was added in By a pedestrian bridge had been erected over Lincoln Park Avenue linking the schools eastern parcel to Mechanical Arts Building No on the western parcel In the s and s a number of portable classroom buildings were added and in a new music building was constructed Additional classrooms were added in and during the s including the New Ceramics and Mechanical Arts Building now the Shop Building and a new pedestrian bridge over Lincoln Park Avenue was built By the northernmost part of the Campus on the western parcel was occupied by Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation HS formerly Lincoln Continuation High School The Campus continued to change in recent years including repair of buildings after the Northridge Earthquake a Campus modernization project and addition of four elevator towers original window replacement inkind at the Administration Home Economics and Auditorium buildings a reconfiguration of areas to create parking lots and landscape features and replacement of original pedestrian bridges with steel bridges Lincoln HS and the Walkouts Lincoln HS was one of five high schools that participated in a series of student protest marches and walkouts in March demanding better educational opportunities for Mexican American students in Los Angeles schools Known as the Walkouts these protests took place at Lincoln Roosevelt Garfield Wilson and Belmont High Schools where over the course of a week an estimated students left their classrooms and marched with supporters for better schools and a better education Previous Evaluation The information presented in this section below is taken from Historic Resources Groups Historic Resources Assessment Report for Lincoln High School No Broadway Los Angeles This report is included in Appendix A In the Lincoln HS Campus was evaluated as part of a larger effort to survey properties damaged by the Northridge earthquake At that time the original buildings of the reconstructed post Long Beach earthquake Campus were identified collectively as a historic district consisting of four contributors the Administration Building the Home Economics Building the Auditorium Building and the Physical Education Building all of which were designed by noted Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin The Lincoln High School Historic District was formally determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources The listing for Lincoln HS does not identify the criteria under which the historic district was determined to be eligible however it is presumed to have been evaluated under Criterion C for its architectural merit and as the work of a master architect LAUSD assigned the Campus a California Historical Resources Status Code of S for the National Register of Historic Places or California Register of Historic Resources through survey evaluation In Historic Resources Group prepared a Historic Resources Assessment Report for Lincoln HS and reassessed the property including buildings constructed after the original period to determine eligibility for Simultaneous protests also occurred at several other supporting District campuses October

and Analysis listing in the California Register of Historical Resources the National Register of Historic Places and the City of Los Angeles HistoricCultural Monument The assessment used criteria and eligibility requirements outlined in the LAUSD Historic Context Statement as well as several additional historic contexts Historic Resources Group identified three overlapping historic districts and five distinct reasons for historic significance Each identified historic district has its own period of significance boundary and contributing and noncontributing buildings and features Two historic districts were identified as significant under Criterion A one for its association with earlyth century school development in Los Angeles including remnant features from when the school was initially established on the site in and the other for its association with the Walkouts Two historic districts were identified as significant under Criterion B one for its association with longtime Lincoln HS principal Ethel Percy Andrus and the other for its association with Lincoln HS teacher Sal Castro Finally one historic district was identified as significant under Criterion C as an excellent example of PWA Moderne architecture and the work of prominent Los Angeles architect Albert C Martin In summary the Historic Resources Assessment Report recommended a total of four Campus buildings and seven additional features ie landscapes hardscapes athletic facilities as contributing to one or more identified historic districts The assessment concluded that the Lincoln HS Campus is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historic Resources and for local designation as a HistoricCultural Monument Table lists the contributing buildings

Analysis Criteria and according to the Historic Resources Assessment prepared in Appendix A The Project includes demolition of the Music Building Building Storage Shed Building Storage Building Build Shop Building and Portables Buildings and as well as the Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation HS bungalows and the construction of new permanent structures as shown in Table and Figure Demolition of these buildings and structures that are not contributors to the historic districts but are within historic district boundaries have the potential to adversely impact historical resources because construction of new buildings and structures within the historic district can diminish the historic integrity of the district Remodel and modernization of historic resources that are contributors to historic districts such as the Administration Building Auditorium Building Home Economics Building Gymnasium Building Music Building and Food Service Building Building as well as the Pedestrian Bridge Building have the potential to cause a substantial adverse change Adverse change can occur if modifications due to the proposed Project including seismic retrofitting impact the characteristics of the historical resources to the extent that it renders them no longer eligible for the CRHR Site improvements can also result in adverse change to historical resources if proposed Project activities will diminish the historic integrity of the design and layout of the district such that it no longer retains sufficient integrity to continue to be listed in the CRHR Throughout the proposed Project LAUSD shall implement processes and professionals who meet the Secretary of the Interiors Professional Qualifications Standards to ensure compliance with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and LAUSD requirements and guidelines for the treatment of historical resources Implementation of SCCUL SCCUL SCCUL SCCUL and SC CUL contain processes that ensure the proposed Project conforms to the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and incorporate features that reduce impacts to the proposed Project to less than

not been evaluated In addition historic aerial photographs dating from and USGS historic maps dating from and illustrate only structures ie school buildings located within the APE were reviewed No CRHR eligible archaeological sites are recorded within or near the Project site Project activities can cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource if construction of new buildings or other activities take place below ground at depths that reach native soils The surficial deposits within the area of potential ground disturbance have been subjected to previous ground disturbance The entire Project site has been historically used as a school with associated facilities The geotechnical study for the project identified to feet of fill across the site specifically the western and central portion of the Project site contains fill deposits and the eastern portion of the project contains nonfill alluvium native soils If construction ground disturbance depths range within native soils there would be a potential to impact previously unrecorded subsurface cultural resources Compliance with existing regulations SCCUL requires that cultural resource sensitivity training be conducted for workers involved in ground disturbance and existing regulation SCCUL stop work for an inadvertent discovery of an archaeological find Therefore Project impact would be less than significant and no further analysis is required c Disturb any human remains including those interred outside of formal cemeteries Less Than Significant Impact The Project site is a public school and no formal cemetery exists on the Project site The Project site has been subject to past subsurface disturbance associated previous construction of school facilities Existing regulations require that if human remains andor cultural items defined by the Health and Safety Code Section are inadvertently discovered all work in the vicinity of the find would cease and the Los Angeles County Coroner would be contacted immediately If the remains are found to be Native American as defined by Health and Safety Code Section the coroner will contact the NAHC by telephone within hours The NAHC shall immediately notify the person it believes to be the Most Likely Descendant MLD as stipulated by California Public Resources Code PRC Section The MLDs with the permission of

Explanation This section describes the proposed Projects potential to affect energy resources Sustainment of day to day operations within communities relies significantly on the availability and use of energy which comes in many renewable and nonrenewable forms including electricity natural gas gasoline diesel solar and wind The efficient use and reduction of energy is closely related to air and GHG reductions Thus efforts to curtail emissions of air emissions and GHG in many ways contribute to the efficient use and reduction of energy consumption Energy used in the United States comes primarily from fossil fuels ie petroleum coal and natural gas and is primarily consumed in five sectors electric power transportation industrial residential and commercial California is among the states with the lowest energy consumption per capita ranking at with million British Thermal Units per capita The US Environmental Protection Agency EPA plays a key role in the conservation and efficient use of energy in the United States In this regard the US EPA has established renewable energy and energy efficiency programs aimed at reducing energy use in all sectors and providing technical information for state policy makers and energy providers US EPA renewable energy programs include energy efficiency programs such as ENERGY STAR a joint program of the US EPA and the Department of Energy certifies energy efficient products eg detergents and appliances techniques for energy savings at home certifies energy efficient new homes and provides energy strategies for

the closest known active fault to the site with evidence of surface rupture is the Raymond Fault which is located approximately miles kilometers to the north It extends southwesterly from the Sierra Madre Fault zone at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains through San Marino and Pasadena to the Raymond Hill area of South Pasadena The review of regional faults identified no known active or potentially active faults with welldefined fault traces delineated by the California Geological Survey CGS consistent with the requirements of the AlquistPriolo Fault Zoning Act that have been recognized as crossing or projecting toward the Lincoln HS site Therefore there would be no impacts associated with rupture of a known earthquake fault and no further analysis is required Ibid Ibid

Checklist and Analysis ii Strong seismic ground shaking Less Than Significant Impact There were faults identified within approximately miles of the Lincoln HS site that are capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude or greater but three faults were recognized to have the greatest potential to produce strong seismic ground motion at the Lincoln HS site These are the Upper Elysian Park Thrust mile north the Raymond Fault miles north and the Puente Hills Blind Thrust miles The CGS has estimated that the Upper Elysian Park Thrust Raymond Fault and Puente Hills Blind Thrust can produce earthquakes with maximum magnitudes of and respectively The Raymond Fault produced the magnitude Pasadena earthquake in while the Upper Elysian Park Thrust has not produced recent earthquakes Earthquake magnitude on the Upper Elysian Park Thrust is estimated from geomorphic evidence from fold growth The Puente Hills Blind Thrust fault is part of a system that extends eastward from downtown Los Angeles to Brea and includes three northdipping segments the Coyote Hills the Santa Fe Springs and the Los Angeles segments The Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation reported that researchers believe the Santa Fe segment is responsible for the Whittier Narrow earthquake in making the Puente Hills Blind Thrust fault an active system capable of producing future earthquakes up to moment magnitude beneath the Los Angeles Basin The new buildings would be designed in accordance with the California Building Code the CGS Special Publication A Guidelines for Evaluating and Mitigating Seismic Hazards in California and the CGS Checklist for the Review of GeologicSeismic Reports for California Schools Hospitals and Essential Services Buildings The Project also requires review from the DSA for compliance with design and construction and accessibility standards and codes including seismic requirements LAUSD with oversight from DSA would comply with these requirements in the design and construction of the new buildings Seismic ground shaking impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required iii Seismicrelated ground failure including liquefaction Less Than Significant Impact Permanent ground displacement from ground lurching or liquefaction can occur in response to seismic shaking Lurching occurs on slopes with strong topographic relief near the earthquake source Lurching is typically observed as permanent ground cracks extending several feet and up to tens of feet below the surface with vertical ground displacement occurring between the cracks Lurching can sometimes be confused with surface rupture of the affected fault Strong seismic motion near the Lincoln HS site does not pose a significant lurching hazard to existing structures Liquefaction occurs when water saturated shallow soils with low intergrain cohesion are subjected to strong seismic shaking The strong shaking increases the pore pressure between sediment grains to reduce soil shear strength and stiffness causing the material to liquify and flow Liquefaction can cause differential settlement of structures built atop atrisk soils and greatest risk occurs for structures where groundwater is less than feet from the surface Ibid Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T I N I T I A L S T U D Y L O S A N G E L E S U N I F I E D S C H O O L D I S T R I C T Environmental Checklist and Analysis CGS has mapped the Lincoln HS site within a Liquefaction Hazard Zone However because predominantly clayey soils with high cohesion are present at the Lincoln HS site the risk from liquefaction was considered low Therefore there would be less than significant impacts associated with rupture of a known earthquake fault and no further analysis is required iv Landslides Less Than Significant Impact The Lincoln HS site does not lie in an area designated at risk for seismically induced landslides by CGS Based upon their site reconnaissance and review of geologic maps it was determined that the slopes at the site do not present a significant hazard from seismically induced landslides because the geologic materials are not considered to be adversely oriented and existing and proposed retaining walls and features eg the concrete stadium seating at the site further reduce risk Therefore there would be less than significant impacts associated with seismically induced landslides and no further analysis is required b Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil Less Than Significant Impact Compliance with SCHWQ and SCHWQ during construction and operation would result in less than significant impact and no further analysis is required Construction Phase The proposed Project would include grading and earthmoving activities at the Lincoln HS site that could expose soils to erosion from heavy winds rainfall or runoff As the Lincoln HS site construction would disturb more than one acre of soil the prime contractor would be required to comply with SCHWQ Stormwater Technical Manual including obtaining a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES Construction General Permit NPDES General Permit In compliance with the NPDES General Permit and implementing SCHWQ Compliance Checklist for Storm Water Requirements at Construction Sites the prime contractor would be required to implement a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program SWPPP which would stipulate specific Per SCHWQ construction contractors will then be responsible for implementation of the SWPPP and

substantial erosion With implementation of SWPPP requirements and associated BMPs erosion impacts related to construction activities would be less than significant Operational Phase With implementation of SCHWQ once operational disturbed areas would be protected by coverings such as structures pavement concrete or vegetation and would result in less than significant impacts on soil erosion c Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable or that would become unstable as a result of the project and potentially result in on or offsite landslide lateral spreading subsidence liquefaction or collapse Less than Significant Impact Hazards arising from liquefaction lateral spreading and landslides would be less than significant as discussed above in Sections VIIaii and iii October Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T I N I T I A L S T U D Y L O S A N G E L E S U N I F I E D S C H O O L D I S T R I C T Environmental Checklist and Analysis Subsidence The major cause of ground subsidence is withdrawal of groundwater The Project would not withdraw groundwater Soils that are particularly subject to subsidence include those with high silt or clay content The school is not in an area of known ground subsidence No largescale extraction of groundwater gas oil or geothermal energy is occurring or planned at the site or in the general site vicinity There is little or no potential for ground subsidence due to withdrawal of fluids or gases at the site Project implementation would not pose substantial hazards to people or structures due to ground subsidence and impacts would be less than significant Differential seismic settlement occurs when seismic shaking causes one type of soil to settle more than another type It may also occur within a soil deposit with relatively homogeneous properties if the seismic shaking is uneven which could occur due to variable geometry for example and variable depth of the soil deposit The potential of differential seismicallyinduced settlement is considered low because of the bedrock and the overlying clayey fills are not subject to seismic settlement and impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required d Be located on expansive soil as defined in Table B of the Uniform Building Code as updated creating substantial direct or indirect risks to life or property Less Than Significant Impact Expansive soils are finegrained soils that can undergo a significant increase in volume with an increase in water content and a significant decrease in volume with a decrease in water content Changes in the water content of an expansive soil can result in severe distress to structures constructed upon the soil According to the Preliminary Geotechnical Investigation there are high plasticity clays with medium expansion potential beneath portions of the Lincoln HS site The report has provided foundation design recommendations to offset the risk of expansive soils e Have soils incapable of adequately supporting the use of septic tanks or alternative waste water disposal systems where sewers are not available for the disposal of waste water No Impact The proposed Project does not include septic tanks or alternative wastewater disposal systems and the Lincoln HS site will continue use of the municipal sewer system after modernization Therefore there are no Project impacts and no further analysis is required f Directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site or unique geologic feature Less Than Significant Impact The surface of the Lincoln HS site has been graded since first construction at the Campus in Therefore it is unlikely that unique paleontological resources would remain within previously graded soils at the site According to the paleontology collection records search conducted for the proposed Project by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County shallow excavations are unlikely to uncover a significant paleontological resource However deeper excavations that extend down into the Puente Formation or any excavations in the Puente Formation exposed in the more elevated terrain of the proposed Project has the potential to uncover significant to highly significant vertebrate fossil remains Implementation of SCCUL which requires a Paleontological Monitor to oversee specific grounddisturbing activities would reduce potential impacts potentially uncovered paleontological resources There are no recognized unique geologic features at the Lincoln HS site Therefore with incorporation of SCCUL Project impacts to unique paleontological resources and unique geologic features would be less than significant and no further analysis is required Page L I N C O

emissions either directly or indirectly that may have a significant impact on the environment b Conflict with an applicable plan policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases Explanation This analysis incorporates the air emission results for the proposed Project using the California Emissions Estimator Model CalEEMod prepared by Tetra Tech see Appendix

force at the time the project is submitted to the Division of the State Architect a Generate greenhouse gas emissions either directly or indirectly that may have a significant impact on the environment Less Than Significant Impact Since the proposed Project would reduce the overall existing area greenhouse gas GHG emissions associated with the operation of the proposed Project are expected to decrease would not have a significant impact on the environment and are therefore not further discussed GHG emissions would result primarily during the construction of the proposed Project On December pursuant to state law ie CEQA Guidelines the SCAQMD Governing Board adopted a proposal for an interim GHG significance threshold for projects where the SCAQMD is lead agency The significance threshold is applicable for stationary sources and can be used for determining significant impacts for proposed projects SCAQMD Under the interim significance thresholds projects can emit up to metric tons MT per year of COeq before being deemed as having significant air quality impacts GHG thresholds are not established for temporary sources eg construction emissions and there are no other federally State or regionally established significance thresholds to support impact assessments of GHG October Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J

threshold for stationary sources does not relate to temporary construction sources it is referenced in this analysis to gage the potential significant impact resulting from the proposed Project GHG emissions from the construction activities of the proposed Project were calculated using CalEEMod Detailed CalEEMod input values and output results are included in Appendix D The total calculated GHG emissions resulting from the construction activities significant thresholds and assessment of significance are summarized in Table Table Project GHG Construction Emissions Calendar Year Annual MT COe Maximum Threshold of Significance Significant No Notes GHG greenhouse gas MT COe metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent As presented in Table GHG emissions from construction activities do not exceed annual interim emissions threshold and therefore represent less than significant impacts No further analysis is required b Conflict with an applicable plan policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases Less than Significant GHG emissions would result in an adverse impact if the proposed Project conflicts with any of the plans policies or regulations adopted for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions in the City of Los Angeles The City of Los Angeles does not have a specific greenhouse plan element in its General Plan but it has strategies aimed at reducing GHGs Since the proposed Project does not add long term emissions of GHG and its land use would not change it is not anticipated to interfere with the City of Los Angeles GHG policies Therefore Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T I N I T I A L S T

a list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section and as a result would it create a significant hazard to the public or the environment Less Than Significant Impact The Cortese list is the list of hazardous materials sites compiled and maintained by DTSC pursuant to Government Code Section The Cortese list aggregates data from several sources According to the Phase I ESA the Lincoln HS site was not included on the Cortese list However the PEAE identified arsenic to be present at the Lincoln HS site above DTSCadopted background SL of mgkg and lead to be present

in building materials organochlorine pesticides OCPs polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs volatile organic compounds petroleum hydrocarbons from gasoline diesel and motor oil and naphthalene These COCs were used or stored at the Lincoln HS site in the Shop Building in flammables storage lockers in the North Parking Lot in a firing range in the Auditorium Building basement at a historical gasoline service station located on the property between and and from the past use of pesticides The Phase I ESA also identified data gaps in the Phase I ESA that included a lack of asbestos and lead based paint survey information a lack of information or investigation of a historical gasoline service station present at the Lincoln HS site between and and a lack of information on the abandonment or investigation of an oilwater separator at the Shop Building Phase II Environmental Site Assessment A PEAE was completed for the Lincoln HS site to investigate the presence of COCs identified by the

Additional Site Assessment The findings of the PEAE indicated that additional site assessment was not warranted for the Lincoln HS site The PEAE recommended the District proceed to a removal action during construction to remove soil containing arsenic lead and chlordane at concentrations greater than DTSC SLs Approximately cubic yards of impacted soil were identified for removal There is no direct exposure potential to students and staff as all impacted soil is currently covered by either grass or in planter areas and also partially covered in asphalt in some areas Los Angeles Regional

plan has not been adopted within two miles of a public airport or public use airport would the project result in a safety hazard or excessive noise for people residing or working in the project area Less Than Significant Impact There are no airports located within miles of the Lincoln HS site based on a review of area maps of Los Angeles County The nearest public airport is San Gabriel Valley Airport formerly known as El Monte Airport located approximately miles east of the Lincoln HS site at North Santa Anita Avenue El Monte California Therefore the proposed Project would not expose people residing or working in the area to excessive noise levels or increased safety hazards related to an airport and Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required f Impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan Less Than Significant Impact Emergency preparedness and response planning and coordination would be coordinated through LAUSDs Office of Emergency Services The existing school currently has an emergency school evacuation plan in compliance with Districts safe

would exceed existing ambient exterior noise levels by dBA or more at a noise sensitive use Construction activities lasting more than days in a threemonth period would exceed existing ambient exterior noise levels by dBA or more at a noise sensitive use Construction activities would exceed the ambient noise level by dBA at a noise sensitive use between the house of pm and am Monday through Friday before am or after pm on Saturday or at any time on Sunday Project operations cause the ambient noise level measured at the property line of affected uses to increase by dBA in CNEL or above dB CNEL The City of Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide identifies land use compatibility standard for noisesensitive land uses as a CNEL of dBA to dBA as conditionally acceptable The guide also established a significant impact if the project contributes to a dBA increase in ambient levels The following section calculates the potential noise emissions associated with the temporary construction activities and longterm operations of the proposed Project and compares the noise levels to the LAUSD City and County standards ConstructionRelated Noise Construction of the proposed Project is planned to start in the nd quarter All Project construction activities are anticipated to be completed within months The Project construction activities are anticipated to occur in phases that include demolition grading building construction paving building interiors and asphalt paving and offsite street work The proposed Project would result in shortterm temporary noise impacts associated with construction activities Construction of the proposed Project would have a minimal impact on daily traffic volumes in the project vicinity associated with construction vehicles and thus would have minimal impact on traffic noise conditions Acoustic emission levels for activities associated with Project construction were based upon typical ranges of energy equivalent noise levels at construction sites as documented by the USEPA and the USEPAs County of Los Angeles Noise Ordinance City of Los Angeles LA CEQA Threshold Guide USEPA Technical Document NTID Noise from Construction Equipment and Operations

Technology Initiatives The USEPA methodology distinguishes between type of construction and construction phase Using those energy equivalent noise levels Leq as input to a basic propagation model construction noise levels were calculated at the nearest residences The basic model assumed spherical wave divergence from a point source Furthermore the model conservatively assumed that all pieces of construction equipment associated with an activity would operate simultaneously for the duration of that activity An additional level of conservatism was built into the construction noise model by excluding potential shielding effects due to intervening structures and buildings along the propagation path from the site to receiver locations The construction activities would require a variety of equipment Typical construction equipment would not be expected to generate noise levels above dBA at feet and most equipment types would typically generate noise levels of less than dBA at feet The highest noise levels during construction are normally generated during site grading and building construction phases Grading equipment would be the loudest equipment used at the site These two phases are expected to generate noise levels ranging from to dBA Leq at the clinic feet north of the Project site to dBA Leq dBA at the homes located feet west from the Project on Alta St to dBA Leq at the homes feet south of the Project on North Broadway to dBA Leq to the east of the Project on Lincoln High Drive and to dBA Leq to the east of the Project on Lincoln Park Ave Lincoln HS would remain operational during Project construction and would be impacted by the construction noise at levels during all construction phases Exterior construction equipment noise levels at school buildings within feet of the construction activities are expected to range from to dBA Leq The construction noise levels at nearby residential homes and at Lincoln HS would be loud enough to temporarily interfere with speech communication outdoors and indoors with the windows open Project construction will need to adhere to LAUSD standard conditions SCN which limits scheduling of high noise activities SCN which limits blasting for demolition SCN which provides mitigation measures for offsite receptors and SCN which provides mitigation measures for onsite receptors Due to the infrequent nature of loud construction activities at the site the limited hours of construction and the implementation of LAUSD standard conditions the temporary increase in noise due to construction Would result in less than significant impacts and no further analysis is required OperationalRelated Noise The proposed Project would consist of implementation and operation of new buildings and modernization features at the Campus However development of the proposed Project would not result in an increase in employee or student capacity at the school As such operational noise analysis has been limited to potential noise impacts to the proposed school buildings and potential noise impacts from reconfiguration of onsite Campus activities The City of Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide limits Project operations to result in an increase to the existing ambient noise level of dBA at the property line of the affected uses or above dBA CNEL The proposed facility will include four new buildings which include rooftop HVAC and exhaust fan units Among USEPA Construction Noise Control Technology Initiatives Technical Report No Prepared by ORI Inc Prepared for USEPA Office of Noise Abatement and Control September

T R I C T Environmental Checklist and Analysis the existing structures four existing buildings will be renovated with new HVAC and exhaust fans units as well The classrooms would be designed and constructed to have an interior CNEL of dBA or less The proposed Project would utilize the existing roadway network The proposed Project would not increase student capacity which would not increase vehicle miles traveled VMT and result in increased noise Therefore Project impacts from traffic generated noise would be less than significant as part of longterm operation and no further analysis is required To determine potential noise effects of the proposed Project during the daily operations of the facility a noise model was constructed to evaluate the effects of the proposed Project related noise sources on the environment Modeling of the project site and surrounding environment was accomplished using CadnaA Computer Aided Noise Abatement which is a modelbased computer program developed for predicting noise impacts in a wide variety of conditions CadnaA allows for the input of project information such as noise source data barriers structures and topography to create a detailed CAD model and uses the most uptodate calculation standards to predict outdoor noise impacts to property lines and adjacent surrounding areas The results are included in Appendix I Noise Modeling Results The mechanical design for the HVAC and exhaust fan units has not been currently prepared Therefore this noise analysis assumed that HVAC units sound power rating would be dBA and the exhaust fans sound power rating would be dBA to account for a worst case analysis In total the Project was assumed to include a total of new HVAC units and new exhaust fans Given the elevated rooftop height for the mechanical equipment and assuming the rooftop mechanical equipment operates simultaneously ie in the worsecase scenario the noise levels from the operation of all the rooftop mechanical equipment would range from dBA Leq at the clinic located to the north of the Project dBA Leq at the residential homes located directly west of the Project on Alta Street dBA Leq at the homes directly south of the Project along North Broadway dBA Leq at the residential homes across Lincoln Park Avenue to the east and dBA Leq at the residential homes across Lincoln High Drive to the east The noise impacts from the rooftop mechanical equipment are less than the predicted current ambient noise levels at the Project site and would result in a dBA or less increase to the existing ambient noise levels Therefore the noise levels generated by the proposed Project as part of longterm operations would be in compliance of SCN that requires new noise generating facilities on LAUSD campuses be designed to either meet the local jurisdictions noise standards or be limited to a dB or less increase over the existing conditions Therefore the Project impacts would be considered less than significant and no further analysis is required b Generation of excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels Less Than Significant Impact Operation of the proposed Project would not expose persons to or cause the generation of excessive groundborne vibration or groundborne noise levels as part of regular school activities However temporary Project construction activities including construction of the classroom buildings site grading as well as infrastructure improvements and utility connections would require the use of equipment that could generate vibration Possible sources of vibration may include bulldozers dump trucks backhoes rollers and other construction equipment that produces vibration No blasting will be required at the Project site Project construction activities would occur within approximately feet from the nearest singlefamily residence and approximately feet from the nearest school building According to the Federal Transit Administration FTA guidelines a vibration level of VdB Vibration Velocity Level is the threshold of October Page L I N C O L N H S C O M P R E H E N S I V E M O D E R N I Z A T I O N P R O J E C T I N I T I A L S T U D Y L O S A N G E L E S U N I F I E D S C H O O L D I S T R I C T Environmental Checklist and Analysis perceptibility for humans For a significant impact to occur vibration levels must exceed VdB during infrequent events Based on the levels published by the FTA and the type of equipment proposed for use at the proposed Project coupled with the distance to the existing identified noise sensitive receptors the vibration levels would range from VdB to VdB at the nearest singlefamily residences The analysis shows that the vibration levels maybe perceptible at the nearest sensitive receptors but will be below the maximum vibration level of VdB This vibration level is considered acceptable for impacts to sensitive receptors Project construction will also occur directly adjacent to the school buildings and will result in vibration levels up to VdB which will exceed the VdB level at the school This would be a significant impact to students and personnel on Campus based on their proximity to the construction activities However with the implementation of SCN that limits scheduling and SCN and SCN the temporary increase in vibration due to construction is considered to result in less than significant impacts and no further analysis is required c For a project located within the vicinity of a private airstrip or an airport land use plan or where such a plan has not been adopted within two miles of a public airport or public use airport would the project expose people residing or working in the project area to excessive noise levels Less Than Significant Impact There are no airports located within miles of the Lincoln HS site based on a review of area maps of Los Angeles County The nearest private airport is the LAPD Hooper Heliport which is located approximately miles southwest of the Campus at Ramirez Street Los Angeles The nearest public airport is San Gabriel Valley Airport formerly known as El Monte Airport located approximately miles east of the Lincoln HS site at North Santa Anita Avenue El Monte Therefore the proposed Project would not expose people residing or working in the area to excessive noise levels related to an airport and no adverse Project impacts would result

Police protection services are provided by the Los Angeles Police Department LAPD Lincoln HS is a closed Campus with several gates that restrict access The gates are generally opened only at the start and end of the school day for morning and afternoon bell periods Since no increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project the range of service calls generated by the operation of the proposed Project would be similar to existing conditions The Project may cause a slight increase in demand for police protection services during construction from possible trespass theft andor vandalism However active construction areas would be fenced and any increase in demand would be temporary and would not require the construction of new or expanded police facilities Therefore the Projects impacts on police protection services would be less than significant and no further analysis is required c Schools Less Than Significant Impact The environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Project are considered throughout the environmental analysis in this Initial Study The proposed Project consists of facility improvements to the existing Campus that would result in a beneficial impact to public school facilities The proposed Project would not increase student capacity nor would it create a substantial number of new jobs that could result in increased demand for school services as part of longterm operations As previously noted Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation HS would be relocated to the Glen Alta Elementary School Campus for approximately one year during construction Both schools would remain operational Pueblo de Los Angeles Continuation HS would return to its previous location following the establishment of permanent space on the Lincoln HS Campus for the school Therefore the Project would have less than significant impacts on public school facilities and no further analysis is required d Parks Less Than Signiant Impact The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks provides park and recreation services in the City The nearest parks to the Project site are Lincoln Park located to the south of the Project site at Valley Boulevard Los Angeles and East Los Angeles Park located to the northwest of the Project Site at North Eastlake Avenue Los Angeles The proposed Project is not dependent upon City parks for student recreational needs as part of longterm project operations During shortterm Project construction activities students may use public recreational facilities Use of public parks would be short term and temporary and therefore would not result in substantial physical deterioration of offsite public recreational facilities Demand for park and recreational facilities are typically linked to an increase in population growth in the area through the development of new housing units or the generation of new jobs The proposed Project does not include housing would not increase student capacity nor would it create a substantial number of new jobs that could result in increased demand for recreational facilities The proposed Project would not would physically alter any existing parks or generate a need for new park facilities as part of longterm project operations Therefore the Project would have no impacts on park facilities and no further analysis is required

are Lincoln Park located to the south of the Project site at Valley Boulevard Los Angeles and East Los Angeles Park located to the northwest of the Project Site at North Eastlake Avenue Los Angeles The proposed Project is not dependent upon City parks for student recreational needs as part of longterm project operations During shortterm Project construction activities students may use public recreational facilities Use of public parks would be short term and temporary and therefore would not result in substantial physical deterioration of offsite public recreational facilities The proposed Project is not anticipated to result in a substantial increase in use of area parks as part of long term project operations since recreational facilities are provided on Campus to support the students recreational needs Demand for park and recreational services is typically linked to an increase in population growth in the area through the development of new housing units or the generation of new jobs The proposed Project would not increase student capacity and thereby would not induce substantial population growth that could result increased demand for recreational facilities Therefore the Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required b Include recreational facilities or require the construction or expansion of recreational facilities that might have an adverse physical effect on the environment Less Than Significant Impact The proposed Project includes facility improvements to the existing Lincoln HS Campus including a new field restroom building batting cage home and visitor concessions and visitor bleachers Please refer to Figure Conceptual Site Plan and modernization of the existing Gymnasium building These recreational facility upgrades are intended to better meet the recreational needs of students on site and would not substantially expand facilities or use of Campus recreational facilities in comparison to existing

Classroom Expansion Project as referenced in the Districts notification letter dated January Request for consultation on all District Projects was received from the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation on January Two consultation dates were set for March and May As a result of the consultation the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation provided the District with suggested mitigation measures for the Projects Following the meeting the District sent a conclusion letter on June determining that the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation have not provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that the Project site has Tribal Cultural Resources TCRs as defined by Public Resources Code PRC Chairman Salas responded to this letter with a request for an additional meeting At the requested meeting held via conference call on August Chairman Salas provided additional oral history and stated that because of the proximity to known TCRs the Project may encounter resources Following the meeting and the Districts request for supporting evidence Chairman Salas provided further tribal history and requested to have a Native American monitor present during all ground disturbances Included with this request was a document describing the same mitigation measures that was previously provided for TCRs In addition the following documents titles are publicly available were included in response to the Districts request for supporting documentation The old Spanish and Mexican ranchos of Los Angeles County Gerald KirkmanHarriman Pictorial and Historical Map of Los Angeles County Kirkman Official map of the County of Los Angeles California Wright Excerpt describing the location of a village Excerpt describing habitations Southwest Museum Leaflet Excerpt describing the number of huts in a rancheria A review of these documents did not find substantial evidence of an existing TCR within the Project site No supporting documents indicated why the Project site should be considered to have a high potential for containing TCRs therefore Native American monitoring for TCRs during all ground disturbances is not required In the unlikely event that constructionrelated ground disturbance results in the discovery of potential TCRs compliance with SCTCR and SCTCR would ensure that potential impacts to TCRs are avoided The Project would comply with SCTCR which requires all construction activities to stop should tribal cultural resources be uncovered during ground disturbing activities SCTCR also requires monitoring should tribal cultural resources be identified during grading With implementation of SCTCR and SCTCR Project impacts to unknown potential tribal cultural resources would be less than significant Impacts would be less than

supplies planned future water conservation and planned future water supplies The renovations modernizations and reconfigurations proposed as part of the Project would not significantly change the existing conditions of the Project site No increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project therefore the proposed Project would generate a water demand similar to existing conditions Furthermore the proposed Project would be required to comply with LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval SCGHG SCGHG and SCGHG which are designed to minimize water loss Therefore sufficent water

during normal dry and multiple dry years and Project impacts would be less than significant and no further analysis is required c Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider that serves or may serve the project that it has adequate capacity to serve the projects projected demand in addition to the providers existing commitments No Impact Wastewater from the Project site is processed through the City of Los Angeles Collection Systems Hyperion Sewershed The renovations modernizations and reconfigurations proposed as part of the Project would not significantly change the existing conditions of the Project site No increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project therefore demand on the existing sewer system and percentage of the wastewater treatment providers capacity utilized by the high school would be similar to existing conditions Additionally site wide utilities upgrades include new sewer lines which will likely improve the existing sewer system as opposed to degrading it Therefore since the Project site is an existing active high school Campus which is already served by the Hyperion Sewershed the proposed Project would not increase the wastewater output of the high school site and site wide utility upgrades are part of the proposed Project the Project would have no impacts and no further analysis is required d Generate solid waste in excess of State or local standards or in excess of the capacity of local infrastructure or otherwise impair the attainment of solid waste reduction goals Less Than Significant Impact Los Angeles Sanitation LASAN is responsible for the collection and removal of all solid waste products icluding refuse recyclables yard trimmings horse manure and bulky items within the City of Los Angeles refuse is sent to landfills recyclables proceed to recycling centers and green waste is turned into mulch which is given away free of cost to City residents Before refuse is sent to a landfill it is first sent to the Central LA Recycling and Transfer Station CLARTS All City owned landfills are closed therefore all landfill waste within the City proceeds from CLARTS to private landfills The renovations modernizations and reconfigurations proposed as part of the Project would not significantly change the existing conditions of the Project site No increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project therefore the operation of the proposed project will likely generate solid waste at a level similar to existing conditions Additionally the proposed Project would comply with LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval SCUSS and SCUSS which are designed to reduce solid waste during both constructiondemolition and operation of the Project Therefore the proposed project would not generate solid waste in excess of State or local standards in excess of the capacity of local infrastructure or otherwise impair the attainment of solid waste reduction goals Project impacts would be

and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste No increase in student capacity is proposed as part of the Project therefore the operation of the proposed Project will likely generate solid waste at a level similar to existing conditions the proposed Project would comply with SCUSS which requires an easily accessible area that services the entire school and is dedicated to the collection and storage of materials for recycling including at a minimum paper cardboard glass plastics metals and landscaping waste The proposed Project would generate previously unaccounted for waste associated with construction and demolition however constrouction would also comply with SCUSS which requires the recycling salvaging andor reusing a minimum of of the constructiondemolition waste

either directly or indirectly Explanation a Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self sustaining levels threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate important examples of the major periods of California history or prehistory Less Than Significant Impact With Mitigation Incorporated As discussed in Section IV Biological Resources the Project site is an existing active high school Campus therefore sensitive species that have the potential to occur onsite are limited to birds and bats that may utilize buildingsurban vegetation In general the habitat quality for native wildlife and plant species on site is poor With the implementation of SCBIO through SCBIO and MMBIO the Project would not have a significant adverse impact on a wildlife or plant species or community As noted in Section V Cultural Resources the Project site is located within three historic districts No CRHR eligible archaeological sites are recorded within or near the Project site As part of the record search the Native American Heritage Commission NAHC was contacted on September to request a Sacred Lands file search The NAHC responded on September that the results are positive for Native American tribal cultural resources as being within the proposed Project study area However with the implementation of SC CUL through SCCUL SCCUL SCCUL SCCUL SCTCR and SCTCR

Myers Senior Air Quality Analyst has conducted a Localized Significance Threshold LST analysis for the proposed Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Project Project owned by the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD The Project is located on Vaughn Street in the community of Pacoima California Project Description The Project site is bounded by Herrick Avenue to the southwest Eustace Street to the southeast DeGarmo Avenue to the northeast and Vaughn Street to the northwest The surrounding neighborhood is made up of single family and multifamily residences within the City of San Fernando with Pacoima to the South Sylmar to the North and Angeles National Forest to the East and Granada Hills and Porter Ranch to the West The campus was originally built in with portable buildings In the campus was reconfigured with permanent buildings The elementary school currently has existing buildings which include an existing administration building library building multipurpose room MPR building with a kitchen and storage facilities The main entrance to the campus and the administrative building is accessed from Vaughn Street The campus has a main play yard in the middle which has an asphalt finish There is a multifunctional service roadfire lane accessed from Herrick Avenue that services the campus kitchen but traverses through the campus playground to reach the kitchen Programmatically the campus operates as one campus in adjunct with the middle school MIT sharing the playground cafeteria lunch shelter and other resources Currently the campus has a total of parking spaces There are three existing shade structures which currently act as lunch shelters The current ADA accessible path of travel includes the MPR parking and the newest buildings which were built as part of the Portables to ProjectBased Pods P project The existing administration building cannot be made accessible as most corridors and door openings are too narrow The proposed Project includes the removal of the existing administration building and replacement with a new building The new twostory building will be approximately square feet and include six Hanover Lane Chico CA Tel Fax Web

pods and student toilet rooms The existing outdoor stage will be upgraded to provide an assembly area for the entire school and the Vaughn community to use The proposed improvements are located along the front entrance of the campus at Vaughn Street The Project proposes to demolish some existing landscape paved walkways approximately square feet of building space fencing a gate site walls and aboveground site features There is also the possibility that the Project will need to remove or relocate some underground utility lines Project Localized Construction Significance Analysis The South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD has established that impacts to air quality are significant if there is a potential to contribute to or cause localized exceedances of the federal andor state ambient air quality standards Localized Significance Thresholds LSTs were developed in response to SCAQMD Governing Boards Environmental Justice Enhancement Initiative I and health concerns raised by the public regarding exposure of individuals to criteria pollutants in local communities LSTs represent the maximum emissions from a project that will not cause or contribute to an exceedance of the most stringent applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard at the nearest residence or sensitive receptor LSTs that show whether a project would cause or contribute to localized air quality impacts and thereby cause or contribute to potential localized adverse health effects The SCAQMD provided the Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology dated June [revised ] for guidance The LST methodology assists lead agencies in analyzing localized impacts associated with Projectspecific level proposed projects This analysis makes use of the methodology included in the SCAQMD Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology The SCAQMD developed LSTs for emissions of nitrogen dioxide NO carbon monoxide CO coarse particulate matter PM and fine particulate matter PM generated at new development sites offsite mobile source emissions are not included in the LST analysis protocol The significance of localized emissions impacts depends on whether ambient levels in the vicinity of the project are above or below state standards In the case of CO and NO if ambient levels are below the standards a project is considered to have a significant impact if project emissions result in an exceedance of one or more of these standards In the case of PM and PM project emissions are considered significant if they increase ambient concentrations by a measurable amount LSTs are based on the ambient concentrations of pollutants within the Project source receptor area SRA as demarcated by the SCAQMD and the distance to the nearest sensitive receptor LST analysis for construction is applicable for all projects that disturb acres or less on a single day The Project site is located within SCAQMD SRA East San Fernando Valley Table shows the LSTs for a acre acre and acre project site in SRA with sensitive receptors located within meters of the Project site Hanover Lane Chico CA Tel Fax Web wwwecorpconsultingcom Vaughn Next

Emissions Estimator Model version CalEEMod software to identify a projects rate of daily disturbance CalEEMod is a statewide land use emissions computer model designed to quantify pollutant emissions associated with construction and operations from a variety of land use projects Since CalEEMod calculates construction emissions based on the number of equipment hours and the maximum daily soil disturbance activity possible for each piece of equipment Table is used to determine the maximum daily disturbedacreage for comparison to LSTs Table EquipmentSpecific Grading Rates Construction Phase

Memorandum As shown in Table Project implementation could potentially disturb up to acres daily during demolition activities acre daily during the site preparation phase of construction and acres daily during the grading phase of construction Thus a LST threshold value for acres of maximum daily disturbance was sourced from the SCAQMD LST lookup tables SCAQMD The nearest sensitive receptors to the Project site are the residences fronting Vaughn Street directly across the street from the Project site In the instance that construction activities occur while school is in session onsite student would also be considered sensitive receptors The SCAQMD has produced look up tables for construction activities that disturb less than or equal to acres daily LST thresholds are provided for distances to sensitive receptors of and meters Notwithstanding the SCAQMD Methodology explicitly states It is possible that a project may have receptors closer than meters Projects with boundaries located closer than meters to the nearest receptor should use the LSTs for receptors located at meters Therefore LSTs for receptors located at meters were utilized in this analysis The SCAQMDs methodology also clearly states that offsite mobile emissions from a project should not be included in the emissions compared to LSTs Therefore for purposes of the construction LST analysis only emissions included in the CalEEMod onsite emissions outputs are considered Table presents the results of localized emissions during the demolition site preparation and grading construction phases The LSTs reflect a maximum disturbance of acres daily for the proposed Project at meters from the nearest sensitive receptors Table ConstructionRelated Emissions Localized Significance Analysis Pollutant

demolition of square feet of building space and square feet of hardscape landscape utilities and aboveground site features Table shows that the emissions of these pollutants on the peak day of construction would not result in significant concentrations of pollutants at nearby sensitive receptors Therefore significant impacts would not occur concerning LSTs during construction activities Hanover Lane Chico CA Tel Fax Web wwwecorpconsultingcom Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Localized Significance Threshold LST Memorandum Project Operations According to the SCAQMD localized significance threshold methodology LSTs would apply to the operational phase of a proposed project only if the project includes stationary sources or attracts mobile sources that may spend long periods queuing and idling at the site such as commonly associated with heavyduty trucks eg warehouse or transfer facilities The proposed Project does not include such uses Therefore in the case of the proposed Project the operational phase LST protocol does not need to be applied Analysis Conclusion Table shows that air pollutant emissions on the peak day of construction would not surpass SCAQMD LSTs and thereby would not result in significant concentrations of pollutants at nearby sensitive receptors Significant LST impacts would not occur during construction activities Similarly Project operations would fall below SCAQMD LSTs since the operational phase of the Project does not include stationary sources of air pollutant emissions Additionally the Project would not attract mobile sources of air pollutant emissions that may spend long periods queuing and idling at the site Hanover Lane Chico CA Tel Fax Web wwwecorpconsultingcom Vaughn Next Century Learning Center

APPENDIX C Cultural Resources Records Search and Literature Review December Mr Dennis Crable West Altadena Drive Altadena California Subject Cultural Resources Literature Review and Records Search for the Vaughn Next Century Project Los Angeles County California Dear Mr Crable At the request of Crable Associates ECORP Consulting Inc carried out a cultural resources study for the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Project Project The Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Mainland campus is a public charter school located at Vaughn Street San Fernando California The Los Angeles Unified School District District proposes to remove and replace the existing main office of the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Mainland campus with a new squarefoot facility to include six learning pods health and administrative offices a medialiteracy center a teacher work room and a cafeteria The proposed Project Area Vaughn Next Century campus is bounded by Vaughn Street to the northwest De Garmo Street to the northeast Eustace Street to the southeast and Herrick Avenue to the southwest The majority of the surrounding area is developed as residential housing churches and businesses Maps showing the Project location are provided below in Figures and ECORP conducted a background literature review for the Project Area consisting of a records search of the California Historical Resources Information System CHRIS a search of the Native American Heritage Commission NAHC Sacred Lands File and the review of historic and geologic maps pertinent to the area Because the Project Area is developed no surfacelevel archaeological resources were likely to be present and an archaeological pedestrian survey was not warranted for this Project The District previously recorded and evaluated all historicperiod buildings and structures within the Project Area for the California Register of Historical Resources CRHR This information is on file with the District At your direction no additional documentation or evaluation work was carried out for the existing buildings and structures ECORPs review used reasonably accessible records search and database information and included the examination of aerial photographs and maps to assist in the identification of archaeological resources within the area and to assess the potential for the Project Area to contain unanticipated subsurface resources REGULATORY CONTEXT To meet the regulatory requirements of the Project the cultural resources investigation was conducted pursuant to the provisions for the treatment of cultural resources contained within CEQA Public Resources Code et seq The goal of CEQA is to develop and maintain a highquality environment that serves to identify the significant environmental effects of the actions of a proposed project and to either avoid or mitigate those significant effects where feasible CEQA pertains to all proposed projects that require state or local government agency approval including the enactment of zoning ordinances the issuance of conditional use permits and the approval of development project maps CEQA Title California Code of Regulations [CCR] Article applies to cultural resources of the historical and precontact periods Any project with an effect that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a cultural resource either directly or indirectly is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment As a result such a project would require avoidance or mitigation of impacts to those affected resources Significant cultural resources must meet at least one of four criteria that define eligibility for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources CRHR Public Resources Code Title CCR Resources listed on or eligible for inclusion in the CRHR are considered Historical Resources under CEQA Sections and of the California Code authorize state agencies to exclude archaeological site information from public disclosure under the Public Records Act In addition the California Public Records Act Government Code et seq and Californias open meeting laws The Brown Act Government Code et seq protect the confidentiality of Native American cultural place information Under Exemption of the federal Freedom of Information Act US Code [USC] because the disclosure of cultural resources location information is prohibited by the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of USC hh and Section of the NHPA it is also exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act Likewise the Information Centers of the CHRIS maintained by the OHP prohibit public dissemination of records search information In compliance with these requirements the results of this cultural resource investigation were prepared as a confidential document which is not intended for public distribution in either paper or electronic format Tribal Cultural Resources are defined in Section of the California Public Resources Code as sites features places cultural landscapes geographically defined in terms of the size and scope sacred places and objects with cultural value to a California Native American tribe that are either included in or determined to be eligible for inclusion in the California Register of Historical Resources or are included in a local register of historical resources as defined in subdivision k of Section or are a resource determined by the lead agency in its discretion and supported by substantial evidence to be significant pursuant to criteria set forth in subdivision c of Section Section b of Assembly Bill established that only California Native American tribes as defined in Section of the California Public Resources Code are experts in the identification of Tribal Cultural Resources and impacts thereto Because ECORP does not meet the definition of a California Native American tribe this report only addresses information for which ECORP is qualified to identify and evaluate and that which is needed to inform the cultural resources section of CEQA documents This report therefore does not identify or evaluate Tribal Cultural Resources Should California Native American tribes ascribe additional importance to or interpretation of archaeological resources described herein or provide information about non archeological Tribal Cultural Resources that information is documented separately in the AB tribal consultation record between the tribes and lead agency and summarized in the Tribal Cultural Resources section of the CEQA document if applicable ECORP Consulting Inc

METHODS Records Search Methods On October ECORP archaeologist Mark Deering conducted a cultural resources records search of the CHRIS at the South Central Coastal Information Center SCCIC located on the California State University Fullerton campus The purpose of the records search was to determine the extent of previous cultural resources investigations and the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites or historic period ie over years in age resources within a onemile meter radius of the Project Area The records search identified resources listed on or determined eligible for listing on the NRHP andor the CRHR located within or near the Project Area Materials reviewed included reports of previous cultural resources investigations archaeological site records historical maps and listings of resources on the NRHP CRHR California Points of Historical Interest California Landmarks and National Historic Landmarks Historic maps reviewed include USGS San Fernando Topographic Quadrangle Map scale USGS Southern California Sheet No Topographic Quadrangle Map scale USGS Pacoima Topographic Quadrangle Map scale USGS San Fernando Topographic Quadrangle Map scale USGS San

USGS San Fernando Topographic Quadrangle Map scale Historic aerial photos taken in and were also reviewed on November by ECORP archaeologist Paige Liss for any indications of property usage and built environment Sacred Lands File Coordination Methods In addition to the records search ECORP contacted the California Native American Heritage Commission NAHC on October to request a search of the Sacred Lands File for the Project Area Attachment B The search was requested to determine whether or not Sacred Lands have been recorded ECORP Consulting Inc Vaughn Next Century Learning Center December by California Native American tribes within the Project Area because the Sacred Lands File is populated by members of the Native American community who have knowledge about the locations of tribal resources The NAHC also provided a list of Native American groups that have historic or traditional ties to the Project Area It should be noted that the Sacred Lands File search will not constitute consultation in compliance with Assembly Bill AB AB consultation is a separate process from cultural technical studies and is not included in this scope of work ECORP assumes that the District as the CEQA Lead Agency will conduct all AB consultation for the Project RESULTS Previous Research The records search consisted of a review of previous research and literature records on file with the South Central Coastal Information Center SCCIC for previously recorded resources historical aerial photographs and maps of the vicinity Within the Project Area there have been no previous

architecturally historic buildings including the home of a great film pioneer David Wark Griffith while others are remnants of historical buildings including a foundation and a single concrete arch bridge These historic sites date from the early nineteenth century up to being used today with modern additions None of these resources are located within the Project Area The District has indicated to you that the historicperiod buildings and structures within the Project Area have already been recorded These records did not show up in the CHRIS records search and are not included in the table

aerial photograph from shows the first evidence of a building on the plot of land that is now the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center By the area looks very similar to today highly built up and industrialized ECORP Consulting Inc Vaughn Next Century Learning Center December Sacred Lands File Results The results of the Sacred Lands File by the NAHC were received on November and the results were positive indicating the presence of a Sacred Land within or within the near vicinity of the Project Area The NAHC recommends contacting the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation for more information see Attachment B The NAHC also provided a list of Native American tribes who may also have knowledge of cultural resources in the Project Area ECORP has not been delegated authority by the Lead Agency to conduct tribal consultation or to follow up with the tribe on the Agencys behalf The District as the CEQA Lead Agency has the responsibility to conduct formal government to government consultation for the project under AB If any additional comments are received after the submission of this report they will be forwarded to the Lead Agency for further consideration and appropriate action Correspondence between the NAHC and ECORP is included in Attachment B Potential for Subsurface Resources In assessing potential for buried archaeological sites ECORP reviewed reasonably available information on natural water and soils data The presence of natural water sources is often an indicator for the potential presence of archaeological resources because precontact Native American communities and post contact Euroamerican and Native American communities exploited natural water courses for a variety of subsistence and economic resources The Pacoima Wash is located approximately meters northwest of the Project Area Geological data from the United States Department of Agriculture USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service NRCS and rockdorg Macrostrat were reviewed to characterize the geology of the local area in reference to archaeological history Certain geological characteristics and formations are more likely to be of concern for archaeological materials Compiled information available from rockdorg lists the parcel as composed of Late Pleistocene to Holocene to Ma young alluvialfan deposits This means that the parcel is predominantly covered in alluvial sediments deposited by ancient and recent water flow within the period of known human habitation in California Holocene alluvial deposits have the potential to contain Native American archaeological sites The Project Area has been entirely paved and developed Thus any nearsurface precontact or historicperiod archaeological sites that may have been present have likely been mixed removed or destroyed by development activities Therefore although sediments with the Project Area have the potential to contain cultural material the likelihood for the presence of subsurface archaeological deposits is considered low Conclusions No archaeological resources were identified within the Project Area as a result of this records search and literature review The Project Area was entirely paved and developed during the mid to late twentieth century This development would have displaced or destroyed any archaeological resources that may have been present on the ground surface An archaeological survey was not completed for the Project because no archaeological resources would be visible on the ground surface Historicperiod maps and photographs show that several of the buildings on the Vaughn Next Century campus are historic in age ECORP Consulting Inc Vaughn Next Century Learning Center December Based on information from you all historic period buildings and structures have already been recorded and evaluated by the Lead Agency District and no further work is needed for these resources ECORP is assuming that the historicperiod buildings were evaluated as not eligible for the CRHR and based on the available information no known Historical Resources are located within the Project Area If this assumption is correct then the proposed Project will not result in impacts to a Historical Resource as defined by CEQA The Sacred Lands File search for the Project was positive and the Project Area overlaps a resource that is considered significant to one or more Native American groups The Sacred Lands File is populated by members of the Native American community who have knowledge about the locations of Tribal Cultural Resources Sacred Lands may or may not correspond to archaeological resources and archaeologists are not the experts in identifying Tribal Cultural Resources and Native American Sacred Lands No indications of precontact Native American archaeological resources were identified within or near the Project Area as a result of this literature review Based on the level of development present no precontact archaeological sites would be visible on the ground surface and no archaeological resources are known to exist within the Project Area However ECORP is providing the results of the Sacred Lands File results to the District to aid in the identification of Tribal Cultural Resources through their consultation with Tribes under AB Under state law the discovery of both archaeological materials and human remains triggers an automatic work stoppage at that location However work can continue in other parts of the Project Area while the District determines in consultation with the Project archaeologist and other parties as appropriate whether or not the find represents a historical resource under CEQA For this reason ECORP recommends that a contractor awareness training be conducted by a qualified archaeologist prior to the start of construction for all construction staff who may work on the Project The contractor awareness training will cover the definition and examples of cultural resources the kinds of archaeological resources that may be found within the Project Area State and Federal regulations governing archaeological resources and procedures to follow in the event that archaeological material or human remains are found In addition ECORP recommends oncall monitoring by a qualified archaeologist working under the supervision of an RPA who meets the Secretary of the Interiors Professional Qualifications Standards for prehistoric and historic archaeology The retention of a project archaeologist will provide reference and expertise for the District should archaeological materials be inadvertently discovered during Project construction In the event that the find includes human remains or remains that are potentially human the Los Angeles County Medical ExaminerCoroner must be notified to determine if the remains are the result of a crime scene or that of a prehistoric Native American If the latter the Medical ExaminerCoroner must notify the California Native American Heritage Commission NAHC to identify a Most Likely Descendent MLD of the remains The MLD will make recommendations to the landowner about the appropriate treatment and disposition of the remains which may or may not require mediation by the NAHC before construction activities may resume The procedures are detailed in Section of the California Health and Safety Code and Section of the California Public Resources Code ECORP Consulting Inc Vaughn Next Century Learning Center December Summary Following the records search and literature review ECORP concluded the following The Project Area has not been previously subjected to a cultural resources survey by a qualified archaeologist however an archaeological survey would not inform the Project due to the lack of ground surface visibility The District maintains that it recorded and evaluated all structures as not eligible for the CRHR ECORP did not peer review these documents or findings which were not filed with the CHRIS Information Center and are not available The Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation possesses additional information about tribal resources and should be contacted Other California Native American Tribes may request consultation under AB which may yield additional information Given that the ground surface is not visible subsurface archaeological deposits may be unearthed during construction Ensuring the dissemination of a contractor awareness training and an oncall archaeological monitor is recommended so that procedures under state law are followed If you

Redlands CA Attn Wendy Blumel Senior Archaeologist re Paleontological resources for the proposed Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Project ECORP Project in Pacoima Los Angeles County project area Dear Wendy I have conducted a thorough search of our paleontology collection records for the locality and specimen data for the proposed Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Project ECORP Project in Pacoima Los Angeles County project area as outlined on the portion of the San Fernando USGS topographic quadrangle map that Julian Acuna sent to me via email on October We have no vertebrate fossil localities that lie directly within the boundaries of the proposed project area but we do have localities nearby from sedimentary deposits similar to those that occur at depth in the proposed project area In the entire proposed project area the surface deposits consist of younger Quaternary Alluvium derived as alluvial fan deposits from the San Gabriel Mountains to the northeast via Pacoima Wash that currently flows just to the northwest These deposits typically do not contain significant vertebrate fossil remains at least in the uppermost layers At depth however older Quaternary sediments that contain significant fossil vertebrate materials are likely to be encountered Our closest fossil vertebrate localities from similar deposits are just north of west of the proposed project area at or near the Van Norman Reservoir These localities include LACM that produced fossil bison Bison at a seventyfive foot depth LACM that contained fossil mastodon Mammut and horse Equus in fill dirt and LACM that produced fossil mammoth Mammuthus and bison Bison in terrace deposits Shallow excavations in the younger Quaternary Alluvium exposed throughout the proposed project area are unlikely to produce significant fossil vertebrate remains Deeper excavations in the proposed project area that extend down into older Quaternary deposits however may well encounter significant vertebrate fossils Any substantial excavations in the proposed project area therefore should be monitored closely to quickly and professionally recover any fossil remains discovered while not impeding development Sediment samples should also be collected and processed to determine the small fossil potential in the proposed project area Any fossils recovered during mitigation should be deposited in an accredited and permanent scientific institution for the benefit of current and future generations This records search covers only the vertebrate paleontology records of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County It is not intended to be a thorough paleontological survey of the proposed project area covering other institutional records a literature survey or any potential onsite survey

Herrick Avenue The entire site encompasses three major tributary areas the building stormwater from the roof will downspout directly into the onsite storm drain pipe and flow into the MaxwellDrywell system to infiltrate into the underground soil The trench drain and catch basin will capture the stormwater runoff from the landscape area and concrete pavement area to the east and south side of proposed building and will be conveyed to the Maxwell drywell system via hard pipe The hardscape areas to the west side of the proposed building will be captured by catch basin and sheet flow towards the Maxwell drywell system The overflow inside the Maxwell will rise up and discharge to the adjacent existing concrete v gutter at the P area from the grate cover and to be curbed drained out to

Vaughn Next Century Learning Center school is located at Vaughn Street in Pacoima California The school is redeveloping their facilities and incorporating a new twostory adminclassroom building to be located at the northern portion of the campus along Vaughn Street The new building will include doubleclassroom pod rooms a library admin space a kitchen space and a media room Noise intrusion is the primary concern of this assessment which will include our recommendation for noise reduction of the facades for the proposed design CSDA Design Group CSDA conducted an environmental noise study for the Vaughn Mainland DCAP building to address the intent of the exterior noise intrusion requirements in the LAUSD Building Acoustical Requirements the California Collaborative for High Performance Schools CHPS and California Green Building Standards Code CALGreen Sections This report includes the following information a Results of an acoustical survey which demonstrates that the classroom building is exposed to a noise level up to Leqhour dBA b An acoustical analysis of exterior building assemblies exposed to the noise source and predicted interior noise levels c The acoustical performance of the proposed construction is expected to achieve the LAUSD CHPS and CALGreen interior noise criteria Acoustical Criteria Table is a summary of the interior noise criteria due to exterior noise levels Table Maximum Background Levels dBA Room Type CHPS EQ Prerequisite Background Noise Criterion LAUSD Background Noise Criterion Classroom Library dBA Offices No suggested criteria Cafeteria No suggested criteria dBA max dBA target dBA max dBA max Public school districts are not subject to local plans codes or ordinances However newly constructed schools are subject to California Building Code CBC requirements CALGreen of the CBC stipulates the following For sites with noise levels above dBA interior noise levels must be no greater than dBA during the noisiest hour of operation Performance Method The dBA threshold of the CHPS and LAUSD criteria as outlined in Table are more stringent than the dBA criterion stipulated by CALGreen thus the recommended target is to meet the dBA CHPS and LAUSD criteria Page of Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Mainland DCAP Environmental Noise Study October CSDA Project No Noise Measurement Results CSDA visited the project site at Vaughn Street Pacoima CA on September to conduct acoustical measurements at the exterior of the existing building The purpose of our noise measurements was to document the existing acoustical conditions during a typical school day Noise Measurement Procedure and Results To document the noise levels at the site and calculate the noise reduction provided by the proposed exterior constructions two simultaneous longterm ie hour noise measurements indicated as LT and LT in Figure were conducted at the project site In addition our analysis includes noise data measured in May along Eustace St indicated as LT in Figure and was used to quantify the contribution of noise from California State Route Sound level meter LT was mounted feet above grade to a utility pole near the north property line of the campus along Vaughn Street Sound level meter LT was mounted feet above grade to a light pole near the west property line of the campus along Herrick Avenue Measurements commenced at AM on September and ended at AM on October A shortterm ie minute measurement was conducted within the school yard along the approximate location of the south facade of the proposed building to quantify the noise level at this location The minute shortterm measurement was correlated with the hour long term exterior measurement to calculate the hourly average Leqhour at the south facade and was used to calculate the noise level at project setbacks During the measurements the average wind speed was miles per hour mph and the maximum wind speed was mph wind noise did not affect the measurement The temperature ranged from a low of F to a high of F and the humidity level ranged from a low of to a high of with no precipitation The equipment was calibrated immediately before and after the measurements with no significant drift in response Figure shows the measurement locations and Table shows the highest hourly equivalent sound levels at the measurement locations The noise environment is dominated by vehicular traffic on Vaughn St as well as Herrick Ave Additionally constant traffic noise can be heard from California State Route to the south of the Vaughn Campus Minor noise sources include residential activity periodic aircraft flyovers birds and outdoor student activity Page of Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Mainland DCAP Environmental Noise Study October

at the new building is below the CALGreen threshold level of Leqhour dBA Analysis and Results The analysis of the resultant interior noise levels due to exterior noise intrusion was based on the architectural drawings dated October our exterior noise study and the proposed construction The exterior facade elements included in the analysis consists of the following construction Exterior wall o STC Example Siding plywood studs layers of inch thick gypsum board Example Exterior concrete wall Exterior Windows o STC Example inch lite inch airspace inch lite Example inch thick monolithic Exterior Door o inch hollow core metal door with perimeter seals and door sweep We calculated interior noise levels at rooms with the highest exterior noise exposure Pod Pod Library and Media which include a composite exterior facade consisting of the elements listed above and the planned interior architectural finishes Based on our analysis we expect Page of Vaughn Next Century Learning Center Mainland DCAP Environmental Noise Study October CSDA Project No the LAUSD and CHPS background noise criterion of dBA and the CALGreen criterion of dBA to be satisfied in the classrooms of the planned

Learning Center is a public charter school located at Vaughn Street in the community of Pacoima within the city of Los Angeles The Campus is owned by the Los Angeles Unified School District District or LAUSD The Campus is leased from the District and is operated by the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center VNCLC The proposed New Administration MediaLiteracy Center Kitchen Building Project Project is required to undergo an environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act CEQA This Initial Study provides an evaluation of the potential environmental consequences associated with this Project California Environmental Quality Act LAUSD is the lead agency for this proposed Project and is therefore required to conduct an environmental review to analyze the potential environmental effects associated with the proposed Project VNCLC is the Project applicant California Public Resources Code PRC Section a states that analysis of a Projects environmental impact is required for any discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies In this case LAUSD has determined that an Initial Study IS is required to determine whether there is substantial evidence that construction and operation of the proposed Project would result in environmental impacts Environmental Process Initial Study This Initial Study was prepared in accordance with state CEQA Guidelines as amended and the LAUSD Procedures for Implementing CEQA to determine if the Project could have a significant impact on the environment The purposes of this Initial Study as described in the state CEQA Guidelines Section are to provide the lead agency with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an Environmental Impact Report EIR Mitigated Negative Declaration MND or Negative Declaration ND enable the lead agency to modify a Project mitigating adverse impacts before an EIR is prepared thereby enabling the Project to qualify for an ND assist in the preparation of an EIR if one is required LAUSD Los Angeles Unified School District Procedures for Implementing the California Environmental Quality Act May VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT facilitate environmental assessment early in the design of a Project provide documentation of the factual basis for the finding in an ND that a Project will not have a significant effect on the environment eliminate unnecessary EIRs and determine whether a previously prepared EIR could be used with the Project The findings in this Initial Study have determined that an MND is the appropriate level of environmental documentation for this Project Mitigated Negative Declaration The MND includes information necessary for agencies to meet statutory responsibilities related to the proposed Project State and local agencies will use the MND when considering any permit or other approvals necessary to implement the Project A preliminary list of the environmental topics that have been identified for study in the MND is provided in the Initial Study Checklist One of the primary objectives of CEQA is to enhance public participation in the planning process public involvement is an essential feature of CEQA Community members are encouraged to participate in the environmental review process request to be notified monitor newspapers for formal announcements and submit substantive comments at every possible opportunity afforded by the District The environmental review process provides several opportunities for the public to participate through public notice and public review of CEQA documents and public meetings Tiering This type of Project is one of many that were analyzed in the LAUSD School Upgrade Program SUP Program EIR Program EIR that was certified by the LAUSD BOE on November LAUSDs Program EIR meets the criteria for a Program EIR under CEQA Guidelines Section a as one prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large Project and are related[a]s individual activities carried out under the same authorizing statutory or regulatory authority and having generally similar environmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways The Program EIR enables LAUSD to streamline future environmental compliance and reduces the need for repetitive environmental studies The Program EIR serves as the framework and baseline for CEQA analyses of later Projects through a process known as tiering Under CEQA Guidelines Sections a and tiering refers to using the analysis of general matters contained in a broader EIR such as one prepared for a program with later EIRs and NDs on narrower Projects incorporating by reference the general discussions from the broader EIR and concentrating the later EIR or ND solely on the issues specific to the later Project The Program EIR is applicable to all Projects implemented under the SUP including Charter Schools The Program EIR provides the framework for evaluating environmental impacts related to ongoing facility upgrade Projects planned by the District Due to the extensive number of individual Projects anticipated LAUSD School Upgrade Program Environmental Impact Report Available at httpachievelausdnetceqa VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT to occur under the SUP Projects were grouped into four categories based on the amount and type of construction proposed The four categories of Projects are as follows Type New Construction on New Property Type New Construction on Existing Campus Type Modernization Repair Replacement Upgrade Remodel Renovation and Installation Type Operational and Other Campus Changes The proposed Project is categorized as Type New Construction on Existing Campus which contemplates demolition and new building construction on existing campuses and the replacement of school buildings on the same location and Type Modernization Repair Replacement Upgrade Remodel Renovation and Installation which includes modernization and infrastructure upgrades The evaluation of environmental impacts related to such Project types and the appropriate level of Project design features and mitigation measures to incorporate are provided in the Program EIR The proposed Project is considered a sitespecific Project under the SUP as analyzed in the Program EIR therefore this MND is tiered from the Program EIR The Program EIR is available for review online at httpachievelausdnetceqa and at LAUSDs Office of Environmental Health and Safety South Beaudry Avenue st Floor Los Angeles CA Project Plan and Building Design The Project is subject to the California Department of Education CDE design and siting requirements and the architectural designs are subject to review and approval by the California Division of the State Architect DSA The proposed Project along with all other SUPrelated Projects is required to comply with specific design standards and sustainable building practices Certain standards assist in reducing environmental impacts such as the California Green Building Code CALGreen Code LAUSD Standard Conditions of Approval SC and the Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools CHPS criteria California Green Building Code Part of the California Building Standards Code is the California Green Building Standards Code also known as the CALGreen Code The CALGreen Code is a statewide green building standards code and is applicable to residential and nonresidential buildings throughout California including schools The CALGreen Code was developed to reduce GHG from buildings promote environmentally responsible costeffective healthier places to live and work reduce energy and water consumption and respond to the environmental directives of the Department of Housing and Community Development Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects SCs were adopted by the BOE on February Board Report Number SCs are environmental California Green Building Standards Code Title Part CHPS criteria are summarized The full requirement can be found at httpschpsnetchpscriteria LAUSD OEHS Standard Conditions of Approval for District Construction Upgrade and Improvement Projects November Available at httpsachievelausdnetceqa VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT standards that are applied to District construction upgrade and improvement Projects during the environmental review process by the OEHS CEQA team to offset potential environmental impacts The SCs were largely compiled from established LAUSD standards guidelines specifications practices plans policies and programs For each SC applicability is triggered by factors such as the Project type and existing conditions These SCs are implemented during the planning construction and operational phases of the Projects The BOE adopted a previous version of the SCs on November Board Report Number They were originally compiled as a supplement to the Program EIR for the SUP which was certified by the BOE on November also Board Report No The most recently adopted SCs were updated in order to incorporate and reflect recent changes in the laws regulations and the Districts standard policies practices and specifications eg the Design Guidelines and Design Standards which are routinely updated and are referenced throughout the Standard Conditions Collaborative for HighPerformance Schools The proposed Project would include CHPS criteria points under seven categories Integration Indoor Environmental Quality Energy Water Site Materials and Waste Management and Operations and Metrics LAUSD is committed to sustainable construction principles and has been a member of the CHPS since CHPS has established criteria for the development of highperformance schools to create a better educational experience for students and teachers by designing the best facilities possible CHPSdesigned facilities are healthy comfortable energy efficient material efficient easy to maintain and operate commissioned environmentally responsive site a building that teaches safe and secure community resource stimulating architecture and adaptable to changing needs The proposed Project would comply with CHPS and LAUSD sustainability guidelines The design team would be responsible for incorporating sustainability features for the proposed Project including onsite treatment of stormwater runoff cool roof building materials lighting that reduces light pollution water and energyefficient design waterwise landscaping collection of recyclables and sustainable andor recycledcontent building materials Project Design Features Project design features PDFs are environmental protection features that modify a physical element of a sitespecific Project and are depicted in a site plan or documented in the Project design plans PDFs may be incorporated into a Project design or description to offset or avoid a potential environmental impact and do not require more than adhering to a site plan or Project design Unlike mitigation measures PDFs are not special actions that need to be specifically defined or analyzed for effectiveness in reducing potential impacts Mitigation Measures If after incorporation and implementation of federal state and local regulations CHPS prerequisite criteria PDFs and Standard Conditions of Approval there are still significant environmental impacts then feasible and Projectspecific mitigation measures are required to reduce impacts to less than significant levels Mitigation under CEQA Guidelines Section includes Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation Rectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the impacted environment Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments Mitigation measures must further reduce significant environmental impacts above and beyond compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations PDFs and SCs VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT The specific SCs are identified under each CEQA topic Federal state regional local laws regulations plans guidelines CHPS criteria PDFs and SCs are considered part of the Project and are included in the environmental analysis Impact Terminology The following terminology is used to describe the level of significance of impacts A finding of no impact is appropriate if the analysis concludes that the Project would not affect the particular topic area in any way An impact is considered less than significant if the analysis concludes that it would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment and requires no mitigation An impact is considered less than significant with mitigation incorporated if the analysis concludes that it would cause no substantial adverse change to the environment with the inclusion of environmental commitments or other enforceable mitigation measures An impact is considered potentially significant if the analysis concludes that it could have a substantial adverse effect on the environment If any impact is identified as potentially significant an EIR is required It is important to note that this Project would increase the student capacity of VNCLC Therefore the application of specific SCs identified under each following CEQA topic and federal state regional local laws regulations plans guidelines CHPS criteria and PDFs would ensure this Project would have a less than significant impact on the environment VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

to provide safe and healthy learning environments that support educational achievement throughout the LAUSD FSD accomplishes this mission by building new school Projects repairing and modernizing school facilities and promoting joint planning with local communities On January VNCLC renewed its year charter for the period of July to June with an LAUSD Boardapproved enrollment capacity of students for grades Transitional Kindergarten TK through an increase of permanent student seats and teacher stations over VNCLCs current enrollment of students In December VNCLC applied for an LAUSD Charter School Facilities Augmentation Grant As part of the grant agreement VNCLC capped Kindergarten enrollment at and the TK enrollment at In order to provide seats for continuing resident students and meet the planned enrollment of VNCLC must increase capacity as students move up the grades especially in elementary in an effort to accommodate the young students of residences Purpose and Need Currently VNCLC has an academic enrollment of students The Project is designed to replace existing student learning spaces from the square feet Administration building that is being demolished and provide adequate classroom space for the planned campus enrollment The purpose and need of the proposed Project is to reduce overcrowding and to provide a safe and healthy learning environment that supports educational achievement for students attending the VNCLC Goals The goals of the proposed Project are to provide a building and site design that meets the space and program requirements of the VNCLC and meet LAUSD design requirements for administrative food services educational and library curriculum Specific proposed Project goals include Provide space to convert from multitrack to

would replace the existing building and would add space for school services such as health and administrative offices a medialiteracy center a teacher work room and a cooking cafeteria The Project would increase the amount of building square footage as well as the number of permanent seats on Campus by more than square feet and approximately seats over years Relatively few new vehicle trips would be generated by the addition of staff as such there would be no appreciable increase in mobile source emissions Construction emissions would be lower than the established SCAQMD significance

Analysis was prepared for the proposed Project by ECORP Consulting Inc Appendix B The analysis and conclusions follow Project Localized Significance Analysis LST The SCAQMD has established that impacts to air quality are significant if there is a potential to contribute to or cause localized exceedances of the federal andor state ambient air quality standards LSTs were developed in response to SCAQMD Governing Boards Environmental Justice Enhancement Initiative I and health concerns raised by the public regarding exposure of individuals to criteria pollutants in local communities LSTs represent the maximum emissions from a Project that will not cause or contribute to an exceedance of the most stringent applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard at the nearest residence or sensitive receptor LSTs show whether a Project would cause or contribute to localized air quality impacts and thereby cause or contribute to potential localized adverse health effects The SCAQMD provided the Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology dated June [revised ] for guidance The LST methodology assists lead agencies in analyzing localized impacts associated with Projectspecific level proposed Projects This analysis makes use of the methodology included in the SCAQMD Final Localized Significance Threshold Methodology The SCAQMD developed LSTs for emissions of nitrogen dioxide NO carbon monoxide CO coarse particulate matter PM and fine particulate matter PM generated at new development sites Offsite mobile source emissions are not included in the LST analysis protocol The significance of localized emissions impacts depends on whether ambient levels in the vicinity of the Project are above or below state standards In the case of CO and NO if ambient levels are below the standards a Project is considered to have a significant impact if Project emissions result in an exceedance of one or more of these standards In the case of PM and PM Project emissions are considered significant if they increase ambient concentrations by a measurable amount LSTs are based on the ambient concentrations of pollutants within the Project source receptor area SRA as demarcated by the SCAQMD and the distance to the nearest sensitive receptor LST analysis for construction is applicable for all Projects that disturb acres or less on a single day

statewide land use emissions computer model designed to quantify pollutant emissions associated with construction and operations from a variety of land use Projects Since CalEEMod calculates construction emissions based on the number of equipment hours and the maximum daily soil disturbance activity possible for each piece of equipment Table is used to determine the maximum daily

Sizehttpwwwaqmdgovdocsdefaultsourceceqahandbooklocalizedsignificancethresholdsfinalsample constructionscenarioreportpdfsfvrsn February VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT The SCAQMD has produced look up tables for construction activities that disturb less than or equal to acres daily LST thresholds are provided for distances to sensitive receptors of and meters up to approximately miles Notwithstanding the SCAQMD Methodology explicitly states It is possible that a Project may have receptors closer than meters Projects with boundaries located closer than meters to the nearest receptor should use the LSTs for receptors located at meters Therefore LSTs for receptors located within meters were utilized in this analysis In addition the SCAQMDs methodology also clearly states that offsite mobile emissions from a Project should not be included in the emissions compared to LSTs Therefore for purposes of the construction LST analysis only emissions included in the CalEEMod onsite emissions outputs are considered The nearest sensitive receptors to the Project site are the residences on Vaughn Street located approximately feet north of the Project site Also in the instance that construction activities occur while school is in session onsite students would also be considered sensitive receptors Table

landscape utilities and aboveground site features Table shows that the emissions of these pollutants on the peak day of construction are wellbelow LST significance thresholds and would not result in significant concentrations of pollutants at nearby sensitive receptors Therefore construction of the proposed Project would not result in a significant impact causing a net increase in criteria pollutants or expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations The impact would be less than significant and no further analysis is required Project Operations According to the SCAQMD LST methodology LSTs would apply to the operational phase of a proposed Project only if the Project includes stationary sources or attracts mobile sources that may spend long periods queuing and idling at the site such as commonly associated with heavyduty trucks eg warehouse or transfer facilities The proposed Project would not attract such uses therefore in the case of the proposed Project the operational phase LST protocol does not need to be applied The Implementation of the proposed project would also result in a net increase of vehicle trips to and from the project site as compared to existing conditions However VNCLC is predominantly a neighborhood VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT school where most of the students reside within the surrounding area However the proposed Project would result in a net increase of sf to the Campus Additionally implementation of the proposed Project would result in an increase in stationary source emissions for HVAC and utilities as compared to existing conditions Although the proposed Project would also result in an increase in stationary source emissions for HVAC and utilities as compared to existing conditions operation of the proposed Project would not result in a significant impact causing a net increase in criteria pollutants or expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations The impact would be less than significant and no further analysis is required d Result in other emissions such as those leading to odors adversely affecting a substantial number of people Less Than Significant Impact d The Program EIR found that implementation of SUPrelated Projects would not create objectionable odors Similarly implementation of the proposed Project would not create objectionable odors The type of facilities that are considered to have objectionable odors include wastewater treatments plants compost facilities landfills solid waste transfer stations fiberglass manufacturing facilities paintcoating operations eg auto body shops dairy farms petroleum refineries asphalt batch plants chemical manufacturing and food manufacturing facilities The proposed Project has no design features that would create such odors Schools do not fall within these types of land uses Constructionrelated odor emissions from construction equipment exhaust and application of asphalt and architectural coatings would be temporary and intermittent in nature Shortterm constructionrelated odors are expected to cease upon the drying or hardening of the odorproducing materials Therefore potential odor impacts associated with implementation of the proposed Project would be considered less than significant The impact would be

historic buildings including the home of a great film pioneer David Wark Griffith while others are remnants of historical buildings including a foundation and a single concrete arch bridge These historic sites date from the early nineteenth century up to being used today with modern additions None of these resources are located within the Project area The Office of Historic Preservations OHP

Ranch [P] and the Auditorium [P ] were reviewed in detail Each record stated that the resource was significant to the history of the area No resources were listed within the Project area Reasonably available natural water and soils data was reviewed to assess the potential for buried archaeological sites The presence of natural water sources is often an indicator for the potential presence of archaeological resources because precontact Native American communities and post contact Euroamerican and Native American communities exploited natural water courses for a variety of subsistence and economic resources The Pacoima Wash is located approximately meters northwest of the Project area In addition geological data from the United States Department of Agriculture USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service NRCS and rockdorg Macrostrat were reviewed to characterize the geology of the local area in reference to archaeological history Certain geological characteristics and formations are more likely to be of concern for archaeological materials Compiled information available from rockdorg lists the parcel as composed of Late Pleistocene to Holocene to Ma young alluvial fan deposits This means that the parcel is predominantly covered in alluvial sediments deposited by ancient and recent water flow within the period of known human habitation in California Holocene alluvial deposits have the potential to contain Native American archaeological sites The Project area has been entirely paved and developed Thus any nearsurface precontact or historicperiod archaeological sites that may have been present have likely been mixed removed or destroyed by development activities However the new building footprint is larger than the existing administrative building and would require subsurface excavation that would likely exceed the previously disturbed area Additionally sediments with the Project area have the potential to contain cultural material No archaeological resources were identified within the Project area as a result of this records search and literature review The Project area was entirely paved and developed during the mid to late

Development of the proposed Project would include shortterm construction activities that would consume energy primarily in the form of diesel fuel eg mobile construction equipment and electricity eg power tools Construction activities would be subject to applicable regulations such as antiidling measures limits on duration of activities and the use of alternative fuels thereby reducing energy consumption There are no aspects of the proposed Project that would foreseeably result in the inefficient wasteful or unnecessary consumption of energy during construction activities In addition the proposed Project would comply with the Building Energy Efficiency Standards which were adopted on May and go into effect for new construction starting January The standards focus on four key areas smart residential photovoltaic systems updated thermal envelope standards preventing heat transfer from the interior to exterior and vice versa residential and nonresidential ventilation requirements and nonresidential lighting requirements Under the standards nonresidential buildings which include Campus buildings will be percent more energy efficient compared to the standards The new building would be considerably larger than the existing structure and as such would result in an increase in the amount of energy that is currently being consumed However in compliance with SCGHG the new buildings would exceed the Building Energy Efficiency Standards and the California Green Building Standards Code CALGreen and would be significantly more energy efficient than the existing building planned for demolition which uses older air conditioning units with lower energy efficient ratios EER and seasonal energy efficient ratios SEER In addition the new building meets Title and CHPS requirements Furthermore because the Project would provide permanent seats for existing and planned growth as a neighborhood school it would not result in a significant increase in motor vehicle transportation energy during operation over existing conditions Therefore the proposed Project would not result in inefficient wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy during construction or

collection records for the locality and specimen data for the proposed Project and found no vertebrate fossil localities lying directly within the boundaries of the proposed Project area However the records search did find evidence of localities nearby from sedimentary deposits similar to those that occur at depth in the proposed Project area The surface deposits in the proposed Project area consist of younger Quaternary Alluvium derived as alluvial fan deposits from the San Gabriel Mountains to the northeast via Pacoima Wash that currently flows just to the northwest These deposits typically do not contain significant vertebrate fossil remains at least in the uppermost layers At depth however older Quaternary sediments that contain significant fossil vertebrate materials are likely to be encountered The closest fossil vertebrate localities from similar deposits are just north and west of the proposed Project area at or near the Van Norman Reservoir Shallow excavations in the younger Quaternary Alluvium exposed throughout the proposed Project area are unlikely to produce significant fossil vertebrate remains Deeper excavations in the proposed Project area that extend down into older Quaternary deposits may encounter significant vertebrate fossils Any substantial excavations in the proposed Project area therefore should be monitored closely to quickly and professionally recover any fossil remains discovered while not impeding development The Project area has been paved and developed Thus any nearsurface precontact or historicperiod archaeological sites

encompasses three major tributary areas the building stormwater from the roof which will downspout directly into the onsite stormdrain pipe and flow into a MaxwellDrywell system to infiltrate into the underground soil The system will be installed in the centerwest portion of the play yard underneath a bolted ring and grate imprinted with Storm Water Only The trench drain and catch basin will capture the stormwater runoff from the landscape area and concrete pavement area to the east and south side of proposed building and will be conveyed to the Maxwell drywell system via hard pipe The hardscape areas to the west side of the proposed building will be captured by catch basin and sheet flow towards the Maxwell drywell system The overflow inside the Maxwell will rise and discharge to the adjacent existing concrete v gutter at the P area from the grate cover then curb drained out to Herrick Avenue As demonstrated in the Hydrology Study for the proposed Project the Maxwell drywell system is more than adequate to handle the volume required for treatment without flooding or backup Also the municipal stormwater program requires the preparation of Low Impact Development LID plans to address runoff pollution from postdevelopment Projects The goal of the proposed Project LID is to capture and mitigate the volume of runoff produced from an th percentile storm event The goal of the overall storm drain system design is to accommodate discharge from at least a year storm event and a hour rainfall event as outlined in the Los Angeles County Hydrology Manual As demonstrated in the Hydrology Study for the proposed Project the Maxwell drywell system has more than enough capacity to handle the volume required for treatment The Hydrology Study also concludes and recommends that The proposed storm drain system will be adequate to convey the peak flow from a year hour rainfall event The LID approach is achieved by use of one Maxwell drywell Overall all surface runoff from the

Noise Ordinance appropriate measures will be taken to reduce the noise impact to the property line and nearest sensitive receptors and onsite during construction For example per SCN semipermanent noise barriers and noise curtains will be used to reduce construction noise activity when applicable In addition neither rock blasting nor pile driving will occur during demolition and construction of the proposed Project Therefore implementation of the Project would not result in temporary significant impacts to ambient noise levels in the vicinity of the Project during construction SCN and SCN require construction equipment to be properly tuned and maintained to ensure excessive noise is not generated and require discussions between the construction contractor and Campus administrators prior to and throughout construction to schedule high noise producing activities at times that minimize disruption to classes SCN Additionally compliance with SCN requires source controls time constraints equipment location and type restrictions etc path controls noise barriers capable of attenuating construction noise by dBA andor receptor controls notification and noise complaint process to reduce noise impacts The specific method under SCN would depend on the type of construction noise duration and classroom disruption As with other construction Projects throughout the LAUSD if construction occurs while classes are in session SCN would be implemented to avoid noise disruptions Additionally SCN would be implemented to control the timing for the operation of noisegenerating equipment and would make every effort to limit the exposure of students to noisy construction phases Finally if the construction noise disruption cannot be avoided the contractor would install noise barriers as appropriate to limit construction noise levels Therefore proposed Project construction would not generate a substantial noise increase in excess of established standardsimpacts would be

aii The provisions of Public Resources Code were established pursuant to Assembly Bill AB AB requires meaningful consultation with California Native American Tribes on potential impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources as defined in Public Resources Code AB applies to all development projects that have a notice of preparation NOP or a notice of negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration filed on or after July Accordingly the Project is subject to the provisions of AB As part of the AB consultation processes LAUSD has sent notification of the proposed Project to Native American tribes with possible traditional or cultural affiliation to the area In accordance with AB a tribe must submit a written request to the relevant lead agency if it wishes to be notified of Projects within its traditionally and culturally affiliated area The lead agency must provide written formal notification to the tribes that have requested it within days of determining that a Project application is complete or deciding to undertake a Project The tribe must respond to the lead agency within days of receipt of the notification if it wishes to engage in consultation on the Project and the lead agency must begin the consultation process within days of receiving the request for consultation Consultation concludes when either the parties agree to mitigation measures to avoid a significant effect if one exists on a tribal cultural resource or a party acting in good faith and after reasonable effort concludes mutual agreement cannot be reached AB also addresses confidentiality during tribal consultation per Public Resources Code Section c As part of their cultural resources records search discussed earlier ECORP contacted the California Native American Heritage Commission NAHC on October to request a search of the Sacred Lands File for the project area Appendix C The search was requested to determine whether or not Sacred Lands have been recorded by California Native American tribes within the project area because the Sacred Lands File is populated by members of the Native American community who have knowledge about the locations of tribal resources The results of the Sacred Lands File by the NAHC was received on November and indicated the presence of Sacred Land within or within the near vicinity of the project area Pursuant to AB LAUSD notified the Native American TribesTribal representatives that are traditionally and culturally affiliated with the Project areas of the Districts proposed Projects Request for consultation Ibid VAUGHN NEXT CENTURY LEARNING CENTER MAINLAND CAMPUS INITIAL STUDY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT was received from the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation and the Fernandeo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians The Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation contacted LAUSD on September via email requesting formal consultation regarding the proposed Project Consultation with the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation occurred on October As a result of this consultation the Gabrieleo Band of Mission Indians Kizh Nation determined that this Project is outside of their tribal area and suggested referring to the Fernandeo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians for tribal consultation The Fernandeo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians contacted LAUSD on September via email requesting formal consultation regarding the proposed Project As a result of this consultation LAUSD has decided to include SCTCR and SCTCR and incorporate language from the suggested mitigation measures MM from the Fernandeo Tataviam Band of Mission Indians consistent with LAUSDs SCs as follows MMTCR In the event that Native American cultural resources are discovered during Project
