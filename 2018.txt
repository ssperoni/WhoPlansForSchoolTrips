LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LA USD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low

OF THE RENEWAL PETITION FOR PATHWAYS COMMUNITY BY THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January I INTRODUCTION On November Pathways Community Pathways Charter School and Petitioners an independent charter school submitted a renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division CSD seeking to renew its charter for a fiveyear term to serve up to students in grades Pathways is serving students in grades currently as a Proposition colocation on the campus of Mervyn M Dymally Senior High located at South San Pedro Street Los Angeles California in Board District and Local District South Pathways was initially authorized to open and operate by the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD or District Board of Education on February II STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR RENEWAL PETITIONS Education Code sections b and b set forth grounds for denying a renewal petition Pursuant to section b a charter school that has been in operation at least four years and is seeking renewal must meet at least one of the following minimum academic performance criteria Attained its Academic Performance Index API growth target in the prior year or in two of the last three years both school wide and for all groups of pupils served by the charter school Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API in the prior year or in two of the last three years Ranked in deciles to inclusive on the API for a demographically comparable school in the prior year or in two of the last three years The entity that granted the charter determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools that the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is served at the charter school A The determination made pursuant to this paragraph shall be based upon all of the following i Documented and clear and convincing data ii Pupil achievement data from assessments including but not limited to the Standardized Testing and Reporting Program established by Article Doc commencing with Section for demographically similar pupil populations in the comparison schools iii Information submitted by the charter school Qualified for an alternative accountability system pursuant to subdivision h of section In addition section a provides that charter school renewals are governed by the standards and criteria set forth in Section and shall include but not be limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed Section b states that [t]he governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a [of section ] The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d [of section ] The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the [fifteen elements set forth in section subdivision b] The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter commencing with Section of Division of Title of the Government Code Ed Code subd b Pursuant to the requirements of SB the District shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal Ed Code aA In addition state regulations require the District to consider the past performance of the schools academics finances and operation in evaluating the likelihood of future success along with future plans for improvement if any CCR Doc III SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION Based on a comprehensive review of the Pathways renewal petition application and the schools record of performance District staff recommends that the Board of Education deny the Pathways renewal petition and adopt these Findings of Fact In Support of Denial of the Renewal Petition for Pathways Community based on the following grounds Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition Ed Code b The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements Ed Code b IV FINDINGS OF FACT IN SUPPORT OF DENIAL A Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the Pathways Community renewal petition Ed Code subd b ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE Pathways record of student academic achievement and growth which includes state standardized assessment data District oversight records and information presented in the renewal petition demonstrates that the school is not likely to successfully implement the educational program described in the renewal petition Although the school has endeavored to establish a supportive school culture and climate Pathways nonetheless has demonstrated lack of capacity to provide a high quality academic high school program for its students especially in comparison to other school choices available to its families As an initial matter it is important to acknowledge that Pathways provides additional supports and access to wraparound services to its students and families The school has reported high rates of student retention and low rates of student suspension truancy and dropout On the academic front however the school unfortunately is failing to provide all of its students with a successful core instructional program that meets their needs Although Pathways Community is in its fourth year of operations due to its slow rollout of one grade per year Pathways Community administered the th grade CAASPP SBAC assessments for the first time in The resulting SBAC scores reveal that the schools instructional program is yielding low absolute levels of student academic performance schoolwide and for all of the schools student subgroups in both English Language Arts ELA and Math Equally important the schools poor performance on the SBAC assessments in ELA and Math is also substantially below the comparative performance levels of all nine of its Resident Schools Exhibit Pathways Community Data Set Exhibit Pathways Community Resident Schools SBAC Data by Subgroup The original Pathways Community petition was approved by the LAUSD Board of Education on February and the school was scheduled to open in the school year Pathways Community did not open however until August Doc On the CAASPP SBAC assessment in ELA only of Pathways Communitys students Met or Exceeded the performance standards which is barely more than half of the median Met or Exceeded percentage achieved by its Resident Schools The charter schools proficiency rate of is percentage points below the lowest performance level of any of its nine Resident Schools which range from to in ELA For example at Mervyn M Dymally Senior High on whose campus Pathways operates and which also opened recently in of students Met or Exceeded standards in ELA which is percentage points above the comparative performance of Pathways Exhibit Pathways students also are performing poorly in Math On the SBAC Math assessment only of Pathways Communitys students Met or Exceeded the performance standards which is less than half of the Resident Schools Median of Again the charter schools proficiency rate of in Math is percentage points below the lowest performance level of any of its nine Resident Schools whose performance ranges from to Exhibit Pathways Communitys CAASPP SBAC results similarly show that its two numerically significant student subgroups are performing at low academic levels in both ELA and Math that are also well below the median and individual performance levels of the schools Resident Schools In ELA of students in the schools Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroup Met or Exceeded performance standards which is a markedly lower percentage than the Resident Schools Median of for the same subgroup and lower than the subgroups performance at all nine of its Resident Schools which ranges from to Similarly of students in the Latino subgroup Met or Exceeded ELA performance standards which is a lower percentage than the Resident Schools Median of and lower than the performance of the same subgroup at all nine of its Resident Schools which ranges from to Exhibits and In Math of students in the schools Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroup Met or Exceeded performance standards which is less than half of the median Met or Exceeded percentage achieved at its Resident Schools for the same subgroup and lower than the subgroups performance at all nine of its Resident Schools which ranges from to Similarly of students in the Latino subgroup Met or Exceeded Math performance standards which is a lower percentage than the Resident Schools Median of and lower than the performance of the same subgroup at all nine of its Resident Schools which ranges from to Exhibits and The schools internal assessment data reflects and confirms these low levels of academic achievement Since opening in Pathways has administered NWEA MAP Measures of Academic Progress assessments Although the NWEA data shows some measure of schoolwide and subgroup academic growth these results nonetheless indicate that Pathways students are making minimal progress toward achieving levels of academic performance commensurate with their grade levels See pages of Exhibit Pathways Community School Renewal Petition Doc For example Pathways has provided comparisons of its Fall and Fall NWEA MAP RIT Rasch Unit scores in Reading and Math disaggregated by subgroup The schools Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroup increased its scores in Reading from to and from to in Math The Latino subgroup increased its scores in Reading from to and from to in Math Although these incremental increases are above NWEAs normed growth expectations ie the growth expected for students already performing at normed grade level the scores also demonstrate that Pathways high school students are still at reading and math levels equivalent to gradelevel norms for upper elementary and middle school students Pathways Communitys record also shows low rates of reclassification for its English Learners The school reclassified zero percent of its English Learners in In the same year the Resident Schools Median was and the Districts Median was In the Pathways reclassification rate again was quite low just In comparison its Resident Schools Median was and the Districts Median was The school reports that its English Learners are showing academic growth on internal assessments eg a point increase in NWEA MAP Reading scores from Fall to Fall and anticipates an reclassification rate in This improvement is not reflected however in the performance outcomes for the English Learner subgroup on the CAASPP ELA assessment Of the English Learners tested zero percent Met or Exceeded performance standards and perhaps more significantly only students Nearly Met the standards Exhibit The schools NWEA results indicate an equivalent low level of performance for its current th grade English Learners Exhibit Petition p These academic outcomes reflect and are consistent with the limited implementation of the academic program described in the schools current charter that has been observed through District oversight For example on May following repeated discussion with the schools leadership regarding the Districts concerns the CSD issued a Notice to Cure regarding the schools failure to serve all students in accordance with the terms of its charter Pathways was allowing th grade students to leave school early as a purported reward for passing AG courses with a C or better and being on track to graduate rather than providing the individualized and enriched learning experience described in the charter Exhibit CSD Notice to Cure dated May and Pathways Response dated June Exhibit Annual PerformanceBased Oversight Visit Report School Year for Pathways Community Charter Loc p Although the school reports that it has now abandoned this practice it highlights the schools lack of capacity to operate a high quality secondary school program and meet the needs of all students including those achieving at or above grade level The Pathways CAASPP SBAC outcomes for this same cohort confirm that the schools early release practice was illconsidered and reflected poor professional judgment In the Pathways annual oversight report CSD staff also reported that based on classroom visits document review and interviews of stakeholder focus groups teachers parents and students the school had only partially implemented the components of its instructional program designed to meet the learning needs of all students including its subgroups and had only partially implemented gradelevel Doc appropriate standardsbased instruction to ensure student mastery and progress towards mastery of the California academic content standards Exhibit p Likewise CSD staff again observed limited implementation of academic program components such as ProjectBased Learning and entrepreneurial skills development as well as a general absence of rigorous academic core instruction when visiting classrooms during the recent annual oversight review conducted on September In its renewal petition Pathways asserts that its academic program is nonetheless successful as demonstrated by its internal records indicating that of the students in its first graduating cohort are on track to graduate in spring and the remaining students are on track to graduate in spring Exhibit Petition p Further of its senior students have passed their AG coursework with a C or better graduation requires only a D or better These anticipated outcomes however do not provide sufficient indication of high quality instruction and academic success at the school in view of Pathways Communitys extraordinarily low academic performance on the state and NWEA standardized assessments The schools improvement plan likewise does not provide sufficient assurances that the school has the current capacity to successfully implement the academic program described in its petition Pathways acknowledges that it has been focused on creating a school environment that addresses the social and emotional needs of its students and is now turning its sights toward its academic program and corresponding outcomes See eg Exhibit Petition pp To support its new focus Pathways has retained a new school administrator for who serves under the supervision of the Executive Director the previous administrator of the school Under the new principal the school has started to hold data days and implement datadriven SMART goals developed in Professional Learning Communities Notwithstanding these recent efforts the schools failure to demonstrate a successful record of academic performance calls into question its capacity to meet the academic needs of its students and adequately prepare them for college and career success OPERATIONS In addition to the schools record of low academic performance the school also has a troubling record in the area of operations First for the past two years the school has received the rating of Developing on its annual oversight evaluations in the category of Organizational Management Programs and Operations and will be receiving the same rating on its oversight evaluation report in Second the CSD has found it necessary to issue the school a number of formal notices related to operational issues over the term of the charter For example just a few months ago on August the CSD issued a Notice to Cure regarding the schools unauthorized entry and occupancy of classroom space on the Dymally campus on August and Exhibit CSD Notice to Cure dated August The schools governing board chair responded to the CSD in a timely manner and expressed the schools commitment to student and campus safety and its intention to take immediate Doc action to address the issues raised in the notice Exhibit Pathways Response to Notice to Cure dated August Notwithstanding the schools prompt response however the CSD remains concerned As stated in the notice [i]n view of these events the District is increasingly concerned about the capacity of PCS to operate its school in a professional safe compliant and educationally sound manner Pathways has known for months that the school has not been allocated space on the th floor of Building on the Dymally campus as demonstrated in conversations between Pathways and the District prior to the start of school and as indicated in its proposed settlement of the dispute resolution process and the Single Year CoLocation Use Agreement that it executed Prior to the start of school the District informed Pathways that Dymally would be using the th floor of Building PCS nonetheless chose to expose the staff and students of both schools to the disruption and potential dangers posed by its actions Exhibit B The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements Ed Code subd b A charter school petition must provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain elements related to its program and operations per the requirements of Education Code section subdivision bAO The following elements do not meet this standard due to erroneous incomplete andor inadequate information which in some instances may also contradict the requirements of law ELEMENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools admission requirements The petition impermissibly provides an exemption from the lottery for siblings of students enrolled in the school Exhibit Petition p Siblings of pupils is a category which may be deemed a preference but not an exemption if permitted by the chartering authority on an individual charter school basis pursuant to AB Moreover the petition does not identify any admission preference for students who reside in the District as prescribed in Ed Code section subdivision dB Ed Code subd dB The petition indicates that the school will deny admission to any student who applies after May of the prior school year even if the school has an open seat The petition states that the open enrollment period for the upcoming school year will start at the beginning of November of the current school year and last until the lottery takes place as needed and no later than May ELEMENT SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION PROCEDURES The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools student suspension and expulsion procedures Doc The petition provides for the suspension of students who have disrupted school activities or otherwise willfully defied school authorities This provision is inconsistent with the LAUSD Board of Educations School Discipline Policy and School Climate Bill of Rights regarding willful defiance Exhibit Petition p The petition includes confusing and conflicting lists of offenses for which Charter School students must mandatory and may discretionary be recommended for suspension andor expulsion including provisions related to firearms Exhibit Petition pp The petition fails to contain a reasonably clear and comprehensive description of Charter Schools student suspension and expulsion procedures including the provision of an impartial appeals body whose members were not involved in the expulsion recommendation or decision Rather the petition provides that a student may be expelled upon the recommendation of the schools Principal and following a hearing before an Administrative Expulsion Panel of one or two of the CoDirectors Exhibit Petition p It fails to identify the one or two CoDirectors or specify the selection process Further the petition provides that this same Administrative Expulsion Panel that handles the expulsion hearing also conducts and presides over the expulsion appeal Exhibit Petition p Separation of the bodyentities responsible for these two processes is necessary to avoid capricious biased andor unfair student disciplinary practices and is necessary to afford students adequate due process The petition fails to describe the schools protocol for postexpulsion support to expelled students and their families to facilitate continued equitable access to education The petition does not describe Charter Schools policies and procedures regarding expulsion rehabilitation plans including the term of expulsion criteria to be set forth in the plan and the process for reinstatement andor readmission following completion of the term of expulsion V RECOMMENDATION Based on the foregoing staff recommends that the Board of Education deny the Pathways Community renewal petition The recommendation of denial is consistent with the requirements of SB As stated in the comments to SB [t]his bill specifies that a charter authorizer must consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the school as measured by the API [Academic Performance Index] as the most important factor for renewal and revocation This does not mean the charter school is automatically not renewed or revoked but it does mean that the charter authority must consider this information as the most important factor in making its decision In other words the charter authority must give extra weight to this factor when it considers all the factors for renewal or revocation Doc In conducting its review of the Pathways renewal petition the District has considered increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant the charter renewal As discussed in detail above Pathways Community does not have two years of CAASPP SBAC results to compare The charter schools CAASPP SBAC results nonetheless show that its two numerically significant student subgroups have achieved significantly low levels of academic performance in both ELA and Math that are also below the median and individual performance levels of the schools Resident Schools Comparison of the schools Fall and Fall NWEA MAP RIT Rasch Unit scores in Reading and Math disaggregated by subgroup show that Pathways students are making minimal progress toward achieving levels of academic performance commensurate with their grade levels The schools Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroup increased its scores in Reading from to and from to in Math The Latino subgroup increased its scores in Reading from to and from to in Math Although these incremental increases are above NWEAs normed growth expectations ie the growth expected for students already performing at normed grade level the scores also demonstrate that the schools students are still at reading and math levels equivalent to gradelevel norms for upper elementary and middle school students In order to deny the renewal petition on the grounds set forth above Education Code section subdivision b requires the Board to make written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more grounds for denying the petition Ed Code subd b Should the Board decide to deny the Pathways Community renewal petition District staff recommends that the Board adopt these findings of fact as its own EXHIBIT CRITERIA FOR RENEWALUpon submission District staff comprehensively reviews each renewal petition application to determine whether the school has met the requirements for renewal set forth in California Education Code sections and Once a charter school is determined to be eligible for renewal under b the school must submit a renewal petition application that upon review is determined to be educationally sound reasonably comprehensive and demonstrably likely to be successfully implemented Ed Code a and Pursuant to the requirements of SB the District shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal Ed Code aA The District shall consider the past performance of the schools academics finances and operation in evaluating the likelihood of future success along with future plans for improvement if any CCR Please see Policy for Charter School Authorizing LAUSD Board of Education February for more

built a safe and caring learning environment has implemented intensive supports for students with specialized learning needs and has established a traumainformed and restorative approach to addressing student behavior that teaches students healthy ways to deal with stress and focuses on keeping students in the classroom and learning With this strong foundation in place and a full and stabilizing staff is a major shift from building a foundation to an intensive focus on academic growth The data demonstrate academic growth particularly for the students who experience the most challenge students with IEPs English Learners and students performing below gradelevel However Pathways recognizes the urgency of providing all students with an intellectually challenging and rigorous skillsbuilding curriculum to prepare them for college career and life long learning In this renewal petition Pathways will celebrate the successes acknowledge the areas of needed growth and articulate a detailed action plan to take the school staff and students to the next level Community Need for Charter School Pathways is located in South Los Angeles just north of Watts zip code The students Pathways serves are from the community and reflective of the needs initially projected in the development of the Pathways Education Program At Pathways of students are socioeconomically disadvantaged of students Latino and are black of students receive special education services and are English Learners of students are in foster care and of students are currently homeless These demographics are similar to those at the schools in the comparison data set provided by LAUSD The schools in this data set are The Diego Rivera Community Schools Public Service Communications Green Design Performing Arts Fremont High School Dymally High School Locke High School Animo College Prep and Jordan Data Comparison Demographics Demographics data from October provided by LAUSD CSD Pathways Community School Additional Demographic Information On average of Pathways students enroll after the first week of school each year These students usually check in after a behavior issue or poor academic performance at another school and in the upper grades they are credit deficient upon arrival Based on an assessment of NWEA MAP scaled score data and average of of incoming th graders perform at grade or below in math and of incoming th graders perform at grade or below in reading Based on the Adverse Childhood Experiences Survey ACES of Pathways students have experienced at least one form of trauma in their lives and of students have experienced or more instances of trauma which leads to a form of PTSD that impacts how a student reacts to stress manages impulsivity and engages in higherlevel thinking skills like reasoning and problem solving Despite these challenges Pathways students are resilient and can be successful in high school college career and life if provided with the supports they need The innovative and researchbased program features built at Pathways over the last three years have provided these supports The table below summarizes the program features the student subgroup they support and the results of implementation thus far The detailed results are addressed in the section that follows Illuminate SIS data report Entries after first week of school Illuminate SIS data report NWEA

starting with the areas of strength for Pathways moving to areas of strategic and demonstrated growth over the last three years and ending with areas of needed growth and an action plan to address that need Retention and Attendance Students cannot learn if they are not at school and in the classroom thus retention and attendance are important indicators that Pathways is reaching all students Pathways will graduate its first senior class in spring An analysis of the cohort data in CALPADS reveals that of the students in co have dropped out compared to of students at the comparison schools Additionally the Pathways truancy rate for school year is less than half that of the comparison schools for the same year Data Comparison Drop Out Rates Truancy As will be discussed later in this section Pathways implemented a traumainformed approach to addressing student behavior for the school year All staff were trained on how trauma impacts behavior and learning and on deescalation strategies to support students who are triggered in class This year also included the addition of a full time social worker who met with students identified for intervention and worked with them and their teachers to develop selfcalming strategies and healthy ways to deal with conflict and stress The social worker was also responsible for referring students and their families to additional services such as counseling housing or drugalcohol preventionintervention In spring the social worker facilitated schoolwide testing for glasses and worked with Vision to Learn to provide free glasses to all students who needed them In the social worker position was formalized via a Material Revision to the charter petition as a Wellness Coordinator and Pathways employs one Wellness Coordinator per gradelevel to address the intensive needs of the student population This preventative approach to addressing student need helped to address the reasons why are truant or drop out of school or before they become an issue For the school year the Drop Out data for Pathways from CALPADS extract for Cohort Drop Out data for comparison schools from httpsdatacdecagovdataquest Cohort more recent cohort data publicly available Truancy data for Pathways and comparison schools are from httpsdatacdecagovdataquest most recent data publicly available Pathways Community School Wellness Coordinators are formally integrated into the Positive Behavior Intervention and Support Plan and the school is working towards zero dropouts and zero truancy Graduation and AG Rates A second indicator of school success is graduation and AG rates As mentioned before Pathways is about to graduate its first cohort of students in spring Of the current senior class of students are on track to graduate in spring and the remaining two students are on track to graduate in spring The students graduating in checked into Pathways in the past year are severely credit deficient and have extenuating circumstances that qualify them for a th year Of the graduating class of students have passed their AG coursework with a C or better As the AG requirements are the same as graduation requirements for Pathways of students have passed the AG requirements with a D or better Data Comparison Graduation and AG Pass Rate Since opening in August Pathways has implemented an educational program that features high levels of personalization that facilitate addressing the varied academic and personal needs of students so that they can focus on learning These structures form a web of supports that do not allow a student to fall through the cracks Gradelevel teaming Teachers work in crosscurricular gradelevel teams and share the same students For example Pathways has one teacher for each subject in th grade geography English Integrated Math Research Methods Spanish and PE While there is some variation based on ability in math and Spanish these teachers share the same students The grade level teams meet during PD time to review data discuss student need and implement individual small group and gradelevel interventions Graduation and AG Pass Rate data for Pathways is from an Illuminate SIS data report Graduation and AG pass rate data for comparison schools from httpsdatacdecagovdataquest Cohort more recent cohort data publicly available Pathways Community School Advisory Teachers at each gradelevel also serve as Advisors for one gradelevel of students Starting with the students in the th grade the Advisors and their Advisory class remain together over the course of the students four years at Pathways Every day starts with Advisory and the class itself serves multiple functions The component most relevant to graduation and AG rates is the Individualized Learning Plan Each year in Advisory students develop and build on academic and personal goals in their Individualized Learning Plan As part of the Advisory curriculum students engage in the SMART goal setting process and then update their classmates on their weekly progress towards meeting the goal Once a goal is accomplished a new goal is set and the process begins again In th grade students set shortterm goals in academic and personal growth As students get older they are encouraged to set longer term goals with a focus on academics and collegecareer preparation In addition to individualized goalsetting the Individualized Learning Plan includes a graduation plan progress reportsreport cards NWEA assessment resultsgrowth reports work samples awards certificates letters of recommendation and resumes To facilitate the development of the Individualized Learning Plans each Advisor meets with each student in hisher Advisory every weeks beginning of the semester midterms and end of the semester Learning Labs Pathways offers an period schedule that includes the core content required for graduation and entrance into a year university AG requirements within periods plus an additional periods for interventions or enrichment Retaining the original personalization function identified in the petition these additional periods have evolved over the course of the last three years to more directly address the learning and academic growth needs of the students at Pathways Prior to the school year Pathways offered the core classes needed for graduation during periods before lunch and Learning Lab during periods and after lunch During the Learning Lab periods there were options from which students could choose or be assigned to Learning Lab based on their learning needs Students with specialized learning needs special education English Learners and students in Advanced Placement are assigned to specialized supports Learning Labs Each specialized lab is taught by the teacher with the associated expertise and incorporates designated supports for each population as well as time for students to work on assignments for their classes with the support of the teacher and instructional aides The special education Learning Labs have been in place since and the EL and AP Learning Labs were created for the school year Students could opt into the City Stage Performing Arts program that was facilitated by a Pathways teacher and taught by working performing artists This program included instruction in drumming guitar dance drama and videoaudio production and performances at Art Share in downtown LA each semester Pathways partnered with City Stage a performing arts nonprofit and was provided services via a grant written by the City Stage ED and the Pathways ED All of the required vendor paperwork was completed each year that the program was implemented and Pathways Community School Students were assigned a regular Learning Lab during which time they were expected to engage in reading for the first minutes of each class and then work on assignments for their classes for the rest of the period These Learning Labs were facilitated by Pathways teachers Prior to the abovereferenced Learning Labs were sufficient to address the needs of th and th grade students and provide an additional web of supports for students who may otherwise fall through the cracks However with th grade students Pathways identified additional needs to be addressed with Learning Lab time Pathways offered a credit recovery class in Integrated Science during period Learning Lab time since students had failed the class in th grade No other individual course had a sufficient number of students to create entirely new section during Learning Lab time Additional credit recovery options were provided via Edgenuity online courses in a Learning Lab that was facilitated by a Pathways teacher with oversight by the Principal SAT and ACT Prep courses were also provided via Edgenuity for students who did not require credit recovery In fall a large number of students failed Integrated Math during the first semester so a math supports Learning Lab was created for those students for the nd semester Pathways also implemented a pilot program during the school year for th grade students who were on track to graduate with a C or better in all classes and preferred to complete their homework and the Edgenuity SATACT prep at home These students were permitted to leave campus after the core content classes were complete for the day after lunch The idea behind this pilot program was to provide incentives for all students to complete their courses with a C or better and reward the students who had achieved that While Pathways was following protocols for parental permission and student sign outs LAUSD expressed concerns regarding instructional minutes and equitable access to curricula for all students Additionally the SBAC data from the spring administration revealed that the high performing students at Pathways were still below the expected proficiency levels and needed additional interventions and enrichment opportunities as well Thus the Pathways leadership decided to discontinue early release in its place expand course offerings and opportunities for Students who are performing below grade level in math or reading as determined by the NWEA MAP assessment conducted at the beginning of the school year are assigned to targeted support classes The classes take place within a Learning Lab setting and are facilitated by a Pathways teacher The students NWEA scores are uploaded into Edgenuitys MyPath Program and students are assigned an online reading or math class based on the needs identified in the NWEA results Students who check in after the beginning of the school year take a placement test directly in Edgenuity MyPath Each teacher monitors student performance via the Edgenuity dashboard and individualized student reports and the data available via the Lesson Mastery reports allows Pathways leadership gradelevel teams and content PLCs to examine patterns of specific standards attainment or challenge Pathways Community School Students who are performing at or above gradelevel and are on track to graduate are offered a choice of electives During the school year these electives include AP calculus statistics EAP senior math environmental science technology graphic design drama journalism philosophysociology personal finance and leadership All of these classes except leadership are UC Approved AG courses th and th grade students who are on track to graduate are supported to participate in concurrent enrollment at El Camino College and are permitted to leave campus early no earlier than am to attend the college class The support includes the college advisor assisting students with the course selection and application process TAP cards for transportation to and from the college campus and the purchasing of books needed for the college classes to build a college book sharing library at Pathways It is important to note that the decision to have students attend classes on the college campus and not have a professor teach a class at Pathways was very intentional to allow students to select from a variety of classes instead all take the same class to support students through the application and course selectionenrollment process so they are familiar with it by the time they graduate and to facilitate a college attending experience for students The selection of El Camino College itself was also very intentional as it ranks very high in transfer rates to the UCs and CSUs and has more of a residential college rather than commuter college experience for students School Culture Research demonstrates that students experiencing poverty and students who have experienced trauma need a strong culture of care high expectations and support in the school setting At Pathways students report feeling safe having an adult at school to help with schoolwork and collegegoing expectations and support at higher rates than the comparison schools Data Comparison School Experience Survey See the section on Instructional Minutes for details on ADA and total instructional minutes requirements Kannapel PJ and Clements SK Inside the Black Box of HighPerforming HighPoverty Schools Lexington Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence Survey data for Pathways is from the School Experiences Survey conducted via Google Forms in October Survey data from comparison schools is from the School Experiences Survey reports for the Diego Rivera Community Schools Fremont High School Dymally High School and Jordan High School Survey data not publicly available for Locke or Animo College Prep Pathways Community School Developing a caring culture where students feel safe is a fundamental component of the Pathways Educational Program As identified in Maslows hierarchy of needs the need for physical and emotional safety and the need for belonging and community must be in place before a person or student is able to strive for achievement or pursue creative or intellectual fulfillment This understanding of the mind is echoed in the research regarding trauma A mind that has experienced trauma and is in a space where he or she does not feel safe is triggered goes into a state of fight flight or freeze This is what is referred to as the survival brain When a brain is in this mode all of the functions are directed to support the brains emergency response system In order to learn students need to use the cerebral cortex or thinking brain and in order for the body to direct its resources to the thinking brain a student must feel safe physically and emotionally A key part of creating a safe space at Pathways is the focus on building community Being part of a community means that you are cared for and that you have others to whom you are accountable or as a student once put it weve got each others backs This community is rooted within Advisory Part of each Monday and Friday of Advisory is dedicated to Community Circles In these circles students learn how to listen to each other share their hopes fears and challenges and support each other to set and work towards their goals These community circles also form the basis of Restorative Justice restorative circles that take place after a conflict occurs between students In order to restore community there must first be community The Advisory curriculum also addresses personal and social growth that develop students personal and social growth from mindfulness to growth mindset healthy boundaries to healthy relationships and selfsabotage to selfcare students at Pathways engage in ageappropriate and critically needed skills and perspectives to thoughtfully and fully participate in their own lives their relationships and in the communities to which they belong including Pathways Another indicator of school culture is suspension rates While Pathways has had higher out of school suspension rates than the comparison schools the data demonstrate a downward trajectory that the school plans to continue via the process of improvement outlined below Data Comparison Out of School Suspension Rates Outofschool suspension rates for Pathways and comparison schools are from the LAUSD CSD Data Set The suspension rates for Pathways were determined to be incorrect Two students were incorrectly marked as outofschool suspension instead of inschool suspension in the report to LAUSD It is flagged and being corrected in CALPADS Pathways Community School The way that Pathways addressed the suspension issue is indicative of the way the school leadership addresses challenge areas identify an issue study the data consult research develop an action plan resource the plan implement the plan and then reflect on implementation for continued improvements At the yearend data review of Pathways leadership identified the suspension rate as an area of concern The team analyzed the data to determine the reasons for which students were suspended There were instances of weapon possession knives and BB gun instances of drug possession or use and instances of fighting The team also analyzed the details of each instance to determine the causal factors and consulted with a counselor and social worker familiar with the community to determine the next steps The counselor recommended that Pathways implement a TraumaInformed approach as a preventative measure and the social worker recommended Restorative Justice to address conflict they also provided resources regarding understanding trauma implementing a traumainformed approach and restorative justice Over the summer the leadership team worked closely with the social worker to develop a Positive Behavior Support and Intervention Plan that incorporates a traumainformed and restorative approach to addressing student behavior Pathways also hired the social worker to support the implementation of the plan for the school year As a result from to the out of school suspension rate decreased by Pathways continues to implement these plans and train teachers and staff on deescalation strategies Now that the school has offices in which to safely keep students on campus for inschool suspension the goal is to further decrease the outofschool suspension rate English Learner Reclassification Rates Last school year spring Pathways dramatically improved the reclassification rate for English Learners The data below are from the CDE Dataquest reclassification reports and it is important to note that each year actually reflects the prior spring reclassification rates During the first year of operations Pathways did not reclassify students In the school year Pathways reclassified one student In spring Pathways reclassified students of the EL population This is not reported on the current publicly available Dataquest reports because it is technically data However CALPADS report below indicates the number of student reclassified in spring Data Comparison English Learner Reclassification Pathways Community School The process by which Pathways leadership addresses areas of challenge is again demonstrated here At the end of the school year the Pathways leadership and ELAC analyzed the English Learner data for the year The data revealed that almost all English Learners at Pathways were either newcomers who just arrived to the country speaking only Spanish or LTELs who had been English Learners for longer than years The NWEA MAP and CELDT data demonstrated that English Learners were experiencing only minimal growth This resulted in few EL students meeting the CELDT or Basic Language Skills Proficiency criteria for reclassification Next the leadership and ELAC members consulted the research on improving instruction for English Learners The research pointed to the critical combination of designated and integrated supports for all English Learners not just the newcomers Additionally the Pathways leadership identified the success of the spectrum of supports provided for students in special education a population that was showing an increased growth in NWEA scores Based on their findings the leadership instituted a strategic plan that outlined the supports for each student group that included a combination of designated and integrated instructional supports at all levels and a transition from modifications to accommodations for the newcomers Each support is summarized in the table and described in detail in the section on Meeting the Needs of All Students ELD years as EL EL years as EL LTEL years as EL Designated ELD class or and English Language Supports Lab English Language Supports Lab English Language Supports Lab or Reading Supports Lab based on need Integrated Cotaught English classes Primary language supports Curriculum modification Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE Curriculum accommodation Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE During the school year Pathways worked with LAUSD to obtain an Alternative Agreement that allowed for additional classroom space to accommodate ELD classes and English Language Supports Labs This year Pathways hired an additional full time English Learner teacher and additional instructional aides to provide supports for English Learners at each grade level The school also provided coteaching professional development for all teachers engaging in coteaching English math special education and EL teachers Pathways Community School As a result of these changes the spring reclassification rate was and the NWEA MAP Reading scores for English Learners grew points from Fall to Fall This was four times the projected growth points and largest score increase of all subgroups Academic Growth Individual Student Growth Since Pathways opened amidst the transition from the CST to SBAC the school has utilized the NWEA MAP Assessment as the standardized normreferenced measurement for student academic achievement and growth The NWEA MAP was also chosen due to its focus on individual student growth the performance of each student in relation to his or herself from test to test Via a variety of NWEA reports students review their individual growth with their Advisor and set goals English math and specialized support teachers reviewed the learning continuum to see where students were academically and made the necessary adjustments to their curriculum to support the highest needs students As a result students at Pathways exceeded the normbased growth projections for fall to fall The growth projection for th grade reading was points and for th grade it was points The actual growth for th grade reading was points for th grade was points and while there were no projections for th grade the actual growth was points In the graph below the orange diamond represents the projected growth and the blue bar represents actual growth NWEA MAP Individual Student Growth Fall to Fall The results are similar in math with a growth projection of points for th grade and points for th grade and an actual observed growth of and respectively NWEA MAP Individual Student Growth Fall to Fall Pathways Community School Academic Growth Aggregate and Subgroup Growth To examine growth in specific subgroups an RIT scaled score report identified the average score for each group in fall dark green on the left and Fall light green on the right In the NWEA MAP Reading assessment these data reveal a pattern of growth for all students with an average growth of points for the year points higher than the projected average growth of points African American students met but did not exceed the growth projection in Reading however students in special education English Learners and students reading below the th grade level in Fall all demonstrated dramatically more growth than projected with points points and points of growth respectively Aggregate and Subgroup Growth NWEA MAP RIT Scores Reading In the NWEA MAP Math assessment all students grew an average of points which is slightly below the projection of points Within the subgroups African American students students in special education and students performing below the th grade level in fall demonstrated higher growth rates than projected with points points and points respectively Aggregate and Subgroup Growth NWEA MAP RIT Scores Math Pathways attributes the growth in the particular subgroups to the programs in place that focus on the subgroups of students who are traditionally underserved Pathways Community School Academic Performance SBAC Data The NWEA Growth Data cited above from fall to fall when applied to the SBAC performance bands Not Meeting Nearly Meeting Meeting and Exceeding indicate that while Pathways students have been demonstrating growth in comparison with themselves and their projected growth the growth between the SBAC bands has not been sufficient and the majority of students still reside within the two lower bands NWEA SBAC Equivalent Reading This is reflected in the spring SBAC the schools first administration of the assessment These data reveal that only of th grade students performed within the Met or Exceeded performance bands in reading and only performed within the Met or Exceeded performance bands in math Comparison Data Academic Performance SBAC Spring Prior to receiving the SBAC results the Pathways leadership was aware that the next change process would be focused on increasing the level of rigor for all students at the school This process as well as the action plan identified to address the challenges is outlined below NWEA SBAC Equivalent Math Pathways Community School Areas of Challenge Strategic Action Plan for Improvement During the first three years of operations Pathways has built a safe and caring learning environment has implemented intensive supports for students with specialized learning needs and has established a traumainformed and restorative approach to addressing student behavior that teaches students healthy ways to address conflict and focuses on keeping students in the classroom and learning With this foundation in place Pathways is engaging in a change process initiated in spring to improve teacher retention more intensively improve academic performance for all students and subgroups and continue to decrease suspension rates increase reclassification rates and maintain low truancy and high graduate rates To do this the Pathways leadership is following the same change process the school engaged in to decrease suspension rates and increase reclassification rates identify an issue study the data consult research develop an action plan resource the plan implement the plan and then reflect on implementation for continued improvements Staffing Issue Teacher retention Data Pathways has had an average of turnover in last years retention Teacher survey data from indicate a need for improved support and communication from the school administration Research According to a paper by the Project on the Next Generation of Teachers the following school factors contributed to increased teacher retention in schools with populations similar to Pathways administrative support and instructional leadership participation in decisionmaking time and formal structures for collaboration and planning shared goals and strong student discipline Specific attainable goals Increase teacher retention rate to at least for and increase per year after until reaching Strategies The first priority was to hire a Principal to take on the instructional leadership teacher supports and daily school management while the Executive Director focused on oversight strategic planning and fiscal strength of the school This would permit the Principal to focus on the key leadership factors associated with teacher retention Evaluation protocols for instructional staff were revised in order to provide time for more feedback and reflection on shared goals and growth areas All staff will be evaluated times per school year in order to allow growth and reflection as teacher obtains strategies and support from administrator and leadership teams Multiple structures were established for teacher participation in decisionmaking time and structures for collaboration and planning and shared goals development and implementation at the grade and schoolwide levels For the school year the Simon Nicole S and Johnson Susan Moore Teacher Turnover in HighPoverty Schools What We Know and Can Do Project on the Next Generation of Teachers Harvard Graduate School of Education Pathways Community School structures have been complemented by the implementation of Professional Learning Communities PLCs Protocols that include content PLCs and a master schedule that allows content teams to share a conference period times per week Implementation of the School Leadership Team SLT and Instructional Leadership Team ILT in order to provide not only instructional support but emotional and social supports in order to build self efficacy for teachers new to the profession or school Addressing student behavior has been an ongoing challenge at Pathways particularly because the implementation of a traumainformed and restorative approach to student behavior looks different than traditional more punitive means that tend to keep students with negative behaviors out of the classroom To address this with new teachers applying to Pathways the Principal and Executive Director were very explicit about the schools approach to addressing student behavior To further support teachers who have students who act out in the classroom Pathways is providing specific training to staff regarding deescalation strategies and has hired Restorative Justice campus aides who can be called into a classroom to assist with the student so the teacher can focus on teaching During the school year the school also has one Wellness Coordinator per gradelevel and an inhouse Tier III counselor to address the more intensive mental health needs of students Resources School year is the first year that the school is fully enrolled with all grades Prior to this year the leadership has maintained a conservative staffing plan in order to remain fiscally strong during the period of growth Hiring additional administrative and support positions is the primary resource needed to address teacher retention and support needs As referenced above Pathways has hired a fulltime principal Restorative Justice Aides a Wellness Coordinator for the th grade and a Tier III counselor Implementation The individuals hired for the school year are in place and fulfilling their job expectations A preliminary survey was conducted at the end of the school year by the Principal in order to determine need areas of support andor improvement During a staff meeting in October of the school year the Pathways Principal using a problem solving approach conducted a town hall to listen to and address teacher and staff needs and concerns The reception for the town hall was positive and the School Leadership Team has developed a list of items to address for school improvement At the end of the semester Pathways leadership will conduct a staff survey to review the progress the school is making on the concerns expressed in the town hall and to identify additional concerns to address during the spring semester Reflection Continued Improvement Throughout the school year classroom walkthroughs formal evaluations and onetoone meetings with instructional staff will serve as formative review of instruction and overall school programs at Pathways At the end of the school year the Pathways leadership will conduct a yearend survey and examine teacher retention rate to reflect on the Action Plan implementation and make adjustments as needed Pathways Community School Challenge Every Student at Every Level Issue Increase SBAC scores for all students and all subgroups Data Since the class of will be taking the SBAC during spring the NWEA MAP data for this class was analyzed to determine the SBAC academic performance goals for NWEA MAP ELA SBAC Equivalent for CO Group Not met Nearly met MetExceeded All students SPED EL Black NWEA MAP Math SBAC Equivalent for CO Group Not met Nearly met MetExceeded All students SPED EL Black Specific attainable goals The goal is to move the majority of students from the Nearly Met to the MetExceeded performance band Thus the SBAC Goals for spring are ELA SBAC Students meeting or exceeding the standards o All students o Special education o English Learners o African American Math SBAC Students meeting or exceeding the standards o All students o Special education o English Learners o African American Research In order to dramatically improve student access to the Common Core State Standards as measured by the SBAC teachers need intensive consistent and frequent professional development and supports that focus on understanding the standards translating them into learning objectives developing curriculum and instruction to facilitate student learning of the standardsobjectives and assessing the attainment of the learning objectives by students Strategies Many of the teacher supports are outlined in the abovereferenced Teacher Retention goal To explicitly address the improvement of student performance on the SBAC the strategies included here focus on the professional development support provided to that end Mizell H Why Professional Development Matters Ohio Leaning Forward Pathways Community School Starting in fall Pathways implemented a schoolwide focus on NWEASBAC results and the standards measured therein the focus shifting from where students are to where they need to be October Data Day included an analysis of the NWEA MAP RIT scores in relation to the SBAC performance bands specifically identifying the standards associated with the Met and Exceeded performance bands During the October Data Day content Professional Learning Communities PLCs examined the ELA or math focus standards and developed SMART goals for the rest of the semester All students will take the winter NWEA MAP in January and the PLCs will analyze these data in the same manner reflect on growth from the previous assessment and identify areas on which to focus for the spring semester In spring the th grade team will engage in a specific SBAC Cycle that reflects the process outlined above with SBAC data instead of NWEA th grade students will take the Interim SBAC in January and the teachers will had score items reflect and establish shared goals in order to increase the performance levels of students The cycle will expand to the th and th grade students in the school year Resources For the school year the calendar includes full PD days Data Days In addition to these three days Pathways is providing substitutes for the th grade team to take additional days to prepare for the SBAC Interim Assessment handscore the assessments review the data and develop SMART goals and specific instructional strategies to address the needs identified in the data To support the development of all teachers Pathways has also directed resources to sending teachers to offsite professional development and trainings For the school year Pathways will add more full day professional development days to the calendar Implementation Pathways implemented its first Data Day in October and each content area PLC has submitted their SMART goals to the Principal The principal and leadership team have Pathways Community School incorporated the goals and instructional strategies into the observations and evaluation tools In just a few weeks there is a noticeable shift in instruction to a more intensive focus on the skills identified in Data Day Reflection Continued Improvement Reflection is built into each subsequent Data Day as teachers examine the goals they set the instructional strategies they planned and the implementation of the plan using contentlevel and NWEA data to determine areas of success and needed improvement SBAC Interim and Summative assessments will provide additional critical data points regarding the progress the school has made towards meeting its goals and during the endofyear professional development session instructional staff will provide input regarding their experience of the Data Day process and suggestions regarding supports and processes for the additional PD days being added for Over the summer the Instructional Leadership Team will meet to review the processes and data from and develop a detailed professional development and teacher support plan for and beyond Addressing District Concerns On July the LAUSD Charter Schools Division sent a letter to Pathways outlining some concerns that needed to be addressed within the renewal petition These concerns include SBAC scores Reclassification rate and supports for English Learners and LTELs Early release for th graders spring Pathways leadership is in agreement with these concerns and has addressed the issues regarding English Learners and Reclassification earlier in the petition pages The school has also addressed the early release for th grade students on pages and of the petition The abovereferenced strategic action plans address teacher retention capacity building and other structures and strategies that will result in improving SBAC scores for all students and each subgroup Please see the table below for the Action Plan Timeline that outlines the action items that have been completed the items in progress and

Statement The mission of the Pathways Community School is to provide the students of South Los Angeles with a highly personalized and academically rigorous educational experience in which all students will graduate with a strong academic foundation critical st Century competencies and the personal and leadership skills necessary for success in college career and life Vision Pathways graduates have a strong academic foundation in literacy numeracy critical thinking research and writing skills They possess key st Century capacities such as initiativetaking collaborative decision making and creative problem solving with a specific knowledge and skill set in entrepreneurism With these skills Pathways graduates develop a sense of selfefficacy and personal responsibility to identify and address issues in their own lives and within the communities they care about Pathways Community School Characteristics of an Educated Person in the st Century Pathways Learner Outcomes During the school year the Pathways instructional staff developed the following Learner Outcomes that reflect the expectations for Pathways students and graduates These outcomes incorporate the acronym HOWL for the Pathways wolves Pathways Wolves Have Character Are honest and vulnerable acknowledge when help is needed and seek it out Speak from the heart in [community and restorative] circles Care for the environment each other and self Use academic language practice using precise language and vocabulary Are upstanders shut down negative actions and discussions Own their Education Find a way use

to realworld situations and scenarios Think critically be open to multiple perspectives and form opinions based on valid reasoning and evidence Communicate critically share opinions using valid reasoning and evidence Use technology responsibly to develop knowledge share ideas and empower yourself and your community How Learning Best Occurs Trauma and the Learning Brain Before discussing how learning occurs it is critical to first discuss readiness to learn and the conditions necessary to facilitate that readiness According to the Adverse Childhood Experiences survey of Pathways students have experienced at least one form of trauma in their lives and or more have experienced three or more forms of trauma The forms of trauma reported on the ACES survey include emotional abuse physical abuse sexual abuse emotional neglect physical neglect domestic violence alcoholdrug abuse mental illness loss of a parent and having a household member in prison These indicators do not include other Pathways Community School traumatic and stressinducing realities such as housing instability losing a friend or family member to violence or experiencingwitnessing violence in the community For the immediate issues of abuse neglect and violence Pathways has an emergency response plan in place to address the issue report it to the appropriate agencies and support the student The issue discussed here is the impact of longterm and multiple instances of trauma on the brain and the conditions that must be in place in order for a survival brain to switch to a thinkinglearning brain A student who has experienced the abovereferenced forms of trauma can be triggered by situations that commonly occur at a school unpredictability sensory overload feeling unsafe rejection loneliness confrontation and intimacy When these triggers occur the student switches into survival brain which is fight flight or freeze In these situations student behaviors are easily misinterpreted by teachers staff and other students and can lead to further escalation or deescalation and a return to the learning brain depending on how the situation is addressed At Pathways teachers and staff are trained to identify a student who is triggered deescalate the situation and call for further assistance if needed The PBIS Plan Wellness Team SST process and Tier III counselor in addition to referrals to additional resources are critical components to the Pathways web of support and help students to identify their own triggers and work towards selfcalming and returning to learning Finally the school culture is focused on facilitating a calm safe environment for all students so as to minimize opportunities for students to be triggered and to allow them to work through a triggering episode in a supportive environment Growth Mindset Another important condition for learning is to foster Growth Mindset Carol Dwecks research on growth vs fixed mindsets demonstrates a critical need for students to develop a growth mindset one in which intelligence is viewed as a result of hard work and not innate With this mindset challenges are viewed as opportunities rather than something that a student is automatically able to do or not do Initially introduced in the math department as a way to challenge the frequent statement Im just not good at math growth mindset is now a lesson taught in Advisory and reiterated in all content areas Constructivism Educational theorist John Dewey advocated for constructivist education wherein students build on prior knowledge and skills to construct new knowledge and skills through the process of engaging in new and challenging experiences Lev Vygotsky further developed this idea through his conception of the Zone of Proximal Development ZPD or the relative distance between what a student knows and doesnt know how much assistance is needed to facilitate new knowledge development and whether that assistance can come from a teacher or through coconstruction of knowledge with ones peers or by ones self Vygotskys theories also contributed to the important part that reflection plays in the learning process Dweck C Even Geniuses Work Hard Educational Leadership V I Dewey J republished How We Think Boston Dover Publications Inc Vygotsky L Mind and Society The Development of Higher Mental Process Cambridge MA Havard University Press Pathways Community School Inquiry Problem Solving ProjectBased Learning Discussed more recently by educational researcher Linda DarlingHammond the concepts of constructivist education are integrated into authentic learning experiences also referred to as inquirybased projectbased or discoverybased learning DarlingHammond cites a wealth of research indicating that these experiences provide students with opportunities to learn content knowledge and develop critical st Century skills through complex meaningful projects that require sustained engagement collaboration research management of resources and development of an ambitious performance or product DarlingHammond further states and other research confirms that to do this successfully teachers must start with clearly defined

routines and genre features of argument writing in unit to learning about narrative and informational genres in Unit The American Short Story AP English Language UC APPROVED B REQ The goals of an AP English Language and Composition course are diverse because the college composition course is one of the most varied in the curriculum The college course provides students with opportunities to write about a variety of subjects from a variety of disciplines and to demonstrate an awareness of audience and purpose But the overarching objective in most firstyear writing courses is to enable students to write effectively and confidently in their college courses across the curriculum and in their professional and personal lives Therefore most composition courses emphasize the expository analytical and argumentative writing that forms the basis of academic and professional communication as well as the personal and reflective writing that fosters the development of writing facility in any context In addition most composition courses teach students that the expository analytical and argumentative writing they must do in college is based on reading as well as on personal experience and observation Composition courses therefore teach students to read primary and secondary sources carefully to synthesize material from these texts in their own compositions and to cite sources using conventions recommended by professional organizations such as the Modern Language Association MLA the University of Chicago Press The Chicago Manual of Style the American Psychological Association APA and the Council of Biology Editors CBE As in the college course the purpose of the AP English Language and Composition course is to enable students to read complex texts with understanding and to write prose of sufficient richness and complexity to communicate effectively with mature readers An AP English Language and Composition course should help students move beyond such programmatic responses as the fiveparagraph essay that provides an introduction with a thesis and three reasons body paragraphs on each reason and a conclusion that restates the thesis Although such formulaic approaches may provide minimal organization they often encourage unnecessary repetition and fail to engage the reader Students should be encouraged to place their emphasis on content purpose and audience and to allow this focus to guide the organization of their writing THIS DESCRIPTION IS TAKEN FROM THE COLLEGE BOARD COURSE DESCRIPTION FOR AP ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPOSITION English UC APPROVED B REQ The goal of the Expository Reading and Writing Course is to prepare collegebound seniors for the literacy demands of higher education Through a sequence of ten rigorous instructional

will be expected to increase their awareness of the rhetorical strategies employed by authors and to apply those strategies in their own writing They Pathways Community School will read closely to examine the relationship between an authors argument or theme and his or her audience and purpose to analyze the impact of structural and rhetorical strategies and to examine the social political and philosophical assumptions that underlie the text By the end of the course students will be expected to use this process independently when reading unfamiliar texts and writing in response to them Course texts include contemporary essays newspaper and magazine articles editorials reports biographies memos assorted public documents and other nonfiction texts The course materials also include modules on two fulllength works one novel and one work of nonfiction Written assessments and holistic scoring guides conclude each unit This course will count as meeting the English requirement for

deepening teachers understanding of the expectations of CCSS and NGSS through ongoing professional support in instructional planning interim data analysis and feedback on instructional practice The process Pathways teachers use for curriculum development is called Understanding by Design UBD sometimes referred to as backwards planning UBD starts with the learning objectives and works backwards to the formative and summative assessments that will measure student progress towards and attainment of the learning objectives and then to the lessons assignments activities and additional instructional materials that will support students in developing the skills and knowledge necessary to meet the learning objectives UBD works well for projectbased learning curriculum design and lends itself to the process of design implementation assessment and reflection to create and improve upon curricula Projectbased learning inquiry and problemsolving plays an important role in the development of the skills necessary for success on the SBAC in college career and life Educational researchers and practitioners at the Buck Institute describe the six key characteristics of projectbased learning and these skills are incorporated into the curriculum at Pathways derives the learning goals from content standards and key concepts of academic disciplines starts with a question inquiry or a problem challenge to which students apply their learning to discover the answer or the solution requires critical thinking problem solving collaboration and various forms of

growth and has started each school year with a full teaching staff Each spring the school recruits teachers via the following sources Posting on the Pathways website Posting on EdJoinorg and Idealistorg Posting on local college education programs listserves and websites UCLA USC CSULA CSULB CSUDH and LMU Information booths and attendance at local college job fairs Recommendations from professors who teach in credentialing programs at local colleges The challenge that Pathways has experienced however is finding experienced teachers and retaining teachers Currently of the teaching staff at Pathways has or fewer years teaching experience and over the last years Pathways has retained an average of of its staff from year to year As attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers is a critical component of students academic achievement Pathways has improved its hiring practices and has included teacher retention as the first goal in its Strategic Action Plan pg Improved Hiring Practices It is typical that charter schools attract teachers who are new to the profession and this is no different at Pathways They key is supporting training and retaining the teaching staff so that the resources the school puts into building the capacity of an instructor stays at the school Thus the first step that Pathways has taken is to improve hiring practices to ensure the teacher will be a good fit for Pathways and that Pathways is also a good fit for the teacher To do this Pathways has implemented the following improvements to its hiring practices Continue to have gradelevel team teachers on the interview panel and ask their own questions Include a representative group of students on the interview panel and ask their own questions students in special education English Learners high achievers students with behavior challenges etc Discuss the schools commitment to the traumainformed approach and restorative practices provide specific scenarios of behaviors that a teacher might need to address and conduct a roleplaying exercise as part of the interview Start the process earlier so there is plenty time for teachers to do multiple interviews a demonstration lesson and observe Pathways classes Focus on Teacher Retention As outlined in the Strategic Action Plan Pathways is employing the following strategies to retain teachers in the school year hiring a principal to focus on instructional leadership multiple structures in place for teacher participation or input in decisionmaking All interview panel members are trained on an interview protocol and review questions that are not appropriate to ask age religion family planning etc All questions are screened prior to the interview Pathways Community School time and structures to facilitate collaboration planning shared goals development implementation and reflection increased supports for addressing student behavior in and out of the classroom The most critical component of teacher retention is a teachers experience of effectiveness and the best way to increase teacher effectiveness is to provide initial ongoing and frequent training and supports to improve their practice Staff Training and Continued Professional Development The purpose of a continued professional learning cycle at Pathways is to incorporate strategic data based trainings and learning experiences that will enhance foundational level skills acquired at the college level Research shows that teachers new to the profession often begin their first year needing extensive support from site administrators Leadership at Pathways has incorporated a comprehensive professional learning continuum for all instructional staff Strategic staffing Building Internal Capacity Staff Orientation

Students English Learners The Pathways Community School ELAC has developed and is implementing its own Master Plan that addresses the needs of English Learners Identification Communication Students who are Limited English Proficient LEP are identified through a Home Language Survey HLS completed by the parentguardian upon enrollment in the school After enrollment Pathways requests State Student Identification numbers from CDE and completes a search for students identified as English Learners within CALPADS to identify students who were not identified in the HLS and to identify students who were identified in the HLS as English Learners but have been redesignated Once the students cumulative records arrive Pathways clerical staff review the records for additional information regarding ELD level CELDT test scores and reclassification Within days of enrollment Pathways communicates the following to the parents of English Learners Initial English language proficiency if relevant Official language classification Instructional program placement Reclassification criteria process Support Services Provided Once a students is identified as an English Learner he or she is classified as ELD or EL or LTEL and is scheduled into the associated instructional supports program See the section below for more detail on each component of the program ELD years as EL EL years as EL LTEL years as EL Designated ELD class or English Language Supports Lab English Language Supports Lab Reading Supports Lab Integrated Cotaught English classes Primary language supports Curriculum modification Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE Cotaught English classes if needed Curriculum accommodation Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE Core Content Language Objectives SDAIE Instructional Supports Designated English Language Development Class ELD Level and classes are provided to students in a small group setting In these classes the teacher uses the Edge National Geographic assessments textbooks workbooks to guide instruction and complements the curriculum with additional supportsassignments as needed English Language Supports Lab Each English Language Development teacher conducts an English Language supports Learning Lab for students in ELD and other English Learners Pathways Community School who are identified as needing more intensive reading supports In each lab students are provided with targeted instruction in English language development and direct supports for accessing the coursework in the core content classes In addition the core content teachers share their unit plans with the ELD teachers so that the supports lab period can be used to preteach vocabulary and provide exposureaccess to content readings prior to experiencing it in the content class Instructional Supports Integrated CoTaught English Classes The th and th grade English courses are cotaught by the gradelevel English teacher and an English Language Development teacher These courses are collaboratively planned and taught to integrate specific English Language Development learning objectives and scaffolding to support English Learners CoreContent Language Objectives SDAIE Methodology Pathways provides professional development and instructional supports to core content teachers to incorporate specific language objectives into their content learning objectives provide academic and contentspecific vocabulary instruction and integrate SDAIE methodology to support English Learners Additionally teachers are trained in and receive continued support to utilize Kate Kinsellas scaffolding and supports for incorporating the use of Academic language into communication writing and speaking across the curriculum Primary Language Supports Students who are at ELD levels and are provided with primary language supports within their corecontent classes These supports include an EL instructional aide to provide translation and direct support as needed translated materialssubtitles texttospeech functions in online reading materials and more intensive scaffolding Curriculum Modification Students who are in ELD levels and receive a modified curriculum in the corecontent classes This modified curriculum includes some texts in Spanish and permits students to submit work in Spanish Curriculum Accommodation Students who are in ELD levels and transition from modification to accommodation All texts are in English and writing is transitioned to English in stages Similar to students with IEPs English Learners in ELD and are provided with additional time to complete their work Reading Supports Class All students who test below grade level are assigned a Reading Supports Class All students are tested at the beginning of the year using the NWEA MAP assessment and students who perform below grade level are assigned to a Reading Supports class Using the Edgenuity MyPath online program students are assigned to a leveled support class based on the results of their NWEA MAP assessment The classes are facilitated by Pathways content teachers Program Monitoring and Evaluation The EL Coordinator is responsible for maintaining an EL Reclassification spreadsheet to track the progress of all English Learners enrolled in Pathways This spreadsheet includes the following data EL beginning date Pathways Community School Indicators for LTEL Special Education CELDTELPAC Scores English class grades weeksemester Basic Language Skills Assessment score Every weeks week progress report semester end the EL Coordinator reviews the English Learner progress report grades to identify students in need of additional interventions and supports After the beginning of each year the EL Coordinator and Principal evaluate the EL program using the following criteria Each student should be advancing one level per year on the CELDT and each student including reclassified students should be progressing toward meeting gradelevel standards based on a grade in English of C or better and additional normreferenced assessments including the NWEA MAP Assessment and the Scholastic Reading Inventory Reclassification Criteria In accordance with California Education Code ELs are considered for reclassified to English proficient upon meeting the following minimum criteria English proficiency on the CELDT Fall only or ELPAC January English grade of C or better Demonstration of Basic Language Skills proficiency on the Scholastic Reading Inventory Recommendation by EL support teacher based on portfolio data Parent consultation and approval Reclassification Process Students who have met the reclassification criteria are identified and parentsguardians are informed of their proficiency both orally and in writing ParentGuardian is invited to attend a Reclassification meeting during which the reclassification criteria are reviewed and the parentguardian has the opportunity to ask questions prior to giving consent for reclassification If the parentguardian gives consent they review and sign the Reclassification document Reclassification Follow Up EL Coordinator ensures that newly reclassified students are scheduled in the appropriate classes and continues to monitor their performance on assessments progress reports Gifted and Talented GATE Students and Students Achieving Above Grade Level The first step Pathways will take is to identify students who need additional challenge to be successful This identification will take place through previous GATE program placementidentification and NWEA MAP test scores Once identified students will be identified as enrichment in their Individualized Learning Plans and will work with their advisor to set appropriately challenging goals for the school year Students in the enrichment program will have access to the following to extend their learning experience at Pathways A rigorous collegepreparatory and projectbased curriculum in the core classes Advanced Placement course offerings Pathways Community School Opportunities to take higher level math classes and AG electives instead of support labs Students who are performing at or above gradelevel and are on track to graduate are offered a choice of electives During the school year these electives include AP calculus statistics EAP senior math environmental science technology graphic design drama journalism philosophysociology personal finance and leadership th and th grade students who are on track to graduate are supported to participate in concurrent enrollment at El Camino College and are permitted to leave campus early no earlier than am to attend the college class The support includes the college advisor assisting students with the course selection and application process TAP cards for transportation to and from the college campus and the purchasing of books needed for the college classes to build a college book sharing library at Pathways Students Achieving Below Grade Level Students achieving below grade level are identified via the NWEA MAP assessment given to all students at the beginning of the year As students check in throughout the school year they are assigned a reading and math assessment via the Edgenuity MyPath program which also identifies student performance levels Once identified students who are performing below grade level in math or reading are assigned to targeted support classes The classes take place within a Learning Lab setting and are facilitated by a Pathways teacher The class content is individualized based on the reading andor math level of each student within the Edgenuity MyPath Program Each teacher monitors student performance via the Edgenuity dashboard and individualized student reports and the data available via the Lesson Mastery reports allows Pathways leadership gradelevel teams and content PLCs to examine patterns and drill down into studentlevel data as well Additionally each students Advisor gradelevel team and Wellness Coordinator monitor student progress via week progress reports SocioEconomically DisadvantagedLow Income Students Students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are identified at the beginning of each school year and upon entry into the school throughout the school year via the meal application which qualifies each student for free or reduced price meals Research demonstrates that students experiencing poverty benefit from high levels of personalized attention at school Since opening in August Pathways has implemented an educational program that features high levels of personalization that facilitate addressing the varied academic and personal needs of students so that they can focus on learning Gradelevel teaming Teachers work in crosscurricular gradelevel teams and share the same students For example Pathways has one teacher for each subject in th grade geography English Integrated Math Research Methods Spanish and PE While there is some variation based on ability in math and Spanish these teachers share the same students The grade level teams meet during PD time to review data discuss student need and implement individual small group and gradelevel interventions Wellness Coordinators Pathways Community School Each gradelevel team includes a Wellness Coordinator who is responsible for all of the students at one grade level approximately ratio Like the Advisor mentioned below the Wellness Coordinator starts with students in th grade and stays with them until graduation This allows for consistency building strong trusting relationships and a familiarity with the whole child and hisher and their familys needs They are responsible for monitoring student academic performance via progress reports and graduation checks They coordinate community resources for students and their families eg housing food access familyparenting counseling drug preventioncessation and physical health issues including free testing and glasses for all students at Pathways And they are responsible for facilitating student success team meetings and Tier interventions in the Pathways RTI process Advisory Teachers at each gradelevel also serve as Advisors for one gradelevel of students Starting with the students in the th grade the Advisors and their Advisory class remain together over the course of the students four years at Pathways Every day starts with Advisory and the class itself serves multiple functions The component most relevant to graduation and AG rates is the Individualized Learning Plan Each year in Advisory students develop and build on academic and personal goals in their Individualized Learning Plan As part of the Advisory curriculum students engage in the SMART goal setting process and then update their classmates on their weekly progress towards meeting the goal Once a goal is accomplished a new goal is set and the process begins again In th grade students set shortterm goals in academic and personal growth As students get older they are encourages to set longer term goals with a focus on academics and collegecareer preparation In addition to individualized goalsetting the Individualized Learning Plan includes a graduation plan progress reportsreport cards NWEA assessment resultsgrowth reports work samples awards certificates letters of recommendation and resumes To facilitate the development of the Individualized Learning Plans each Advisor meets with each student in hisher Advisory every weeks beginning of the semester midterms and end of the semester Students with Disabilities See District Required Language at the beginning of Element Students in Other Subgroups Pathways has other populations of students who require additional supports and attention to be successful foster youth and homeless youth As these students are enrolled they are identified in Illuminate SIS and the Principal and Wellness Coordinators are notified Within a week of enrollment the Wellness Coordinator responsible for the student reaches out to the parent or guardian for a meeting to ensure the student and their family has the support they need Some of these supports are referenced above housing food access etc but other supports are specific to the needs of the student such as TAP cards for transportation clothing school supplies clothes cleaning toiletries etc For students experiencing housing instability in foster care or in the care of someone other than their parents trauma is also sometimes an issue Pathways schoolwide traumainformed approach and Response to Intervention process for addressing academics and behavior supports this population as well Other populations that exist at Pathways but who are not formally reported are students who Pathways Community School have checked in after being expelled or counseled out for fighting or other negative behavior at another school or students who have been incarcerated Immediately after the student is enrolled the Principal and the Wellness Coordinator hold a meeting with the student and the parentguardian to identify the specific challenges or triggers the student may experience to review the traumainformed and restorative practices in place at Pathways and to set up supports for both student and family including mentoringcounseling for the student parentingfamily counseling for the parent If the student is returning to Pathways after being incarcerated in addition to the meeting with the principal and Wellness Coordinator the gradelevel teaching team holds and the students advisory each hold a reentry circle wherein expectations for the student and a commitment to support the students success are shared with the student and he or she is welcomed back to the Pathways community A Typical Day at Pathways While no day is typical when you work with teenagers the description below illustrates a dayinthelife at Pathways It is particularly key to notice the intentionality of the interactions between the teachers and students and the momenttomoment decisions that the teachers make to consciously shape the day Every school day starts with advisory class After the teacher welcomes each student at the door and checks to see how they are doing that day Did anything happen on the way to school Did they get their homework done the class begins promptly at am Depending on what time of year you are visiting the students might be having individual meetings with their advisor regarding their Individualized Learning Plan or engaging in a class activity or project designed to promote the Pathways learning goals collegecareer awareness and personalcommunity health If it is a Monday or a Friday students are participating in a Community Circle passing the talking piece and responding to prompts listening to each other and building community As advisory ends at am students file out of class and the advisor asks one student to hang back a sec She noticed that the student was a little checked out and wanted to speak with him before he went to his class This student has a history of aggressive behavior and impulse control is one of his goals that he has discussed with his Advisory and is being supported by his Wellness Coordinator to achieve He explains that he had a fight with his dad in the morning and hes just in a bad mood The teacher clarifies that the fight was not physical as it has been before lets the student know that she understands him being upset and that he can come in during lunch if he wants to chat she quickly reminds him of some of the strategies he uses keep cool so that his mood doesnt impact his learning and experiences during the rest of the school day He nods a smile curling up at the edge of his lips this is not a new conversation the teacher pats him on the back and sends a message via GroupMe to his next teacher letting him know that the student has an excused tardy and may be easily triggered today This gives the next teacher a heads up for potential issues in class that day so that the teacher is prepared to deescalate move the student back to a place of safety and facilitate the student reengaging in his learning We follow the student to his first period class and as he enters class a couple minutes late and the teacher smiles and nods towards the notebook storage area The student grabs his notebook and Pathways Community School joins the other students in the Do Now being projected He gets to work with a slight smile forming he knows the Advisory teacher communicated to his teacher and he knows this teacher cares for him as well so even though the morning before school was upsetting he is now safe and ready to learn We now notice the rest of the class They are all engaged in their Do Now which is typically a short journal activity quiz notes or reading that is designed to get the students started on the learning objectives for the day and provide the teacher with time to take attendance silently he has known all of his students names since the second day of school It is clear that this is a mathematics classroom from the posters of visual representations of algebraic equations the math vocabulary words posted on the walls and the agenda on the board that outlines the days learning objectives agenda and homework assignments At am minutes into the class the teacher walks around the room to check the Do Now for completion giving stamps to the students who are done making sure to check the latearriving student last so he has time to catch up The activity for the day is graphing linear equations to determine relationships and the Do Now was a short article on obesity and diabetes with some questions about the statistics cited that require them to do some basic calculations The teacher starts the class by calling up students to demonstrate how they worked out the calculations on the board while talking through their thinking After they have worked through the Do Now responses the teacher reviews key vocabulary also posted on the wall Then he poses a question about the relationship between obesity and diabetes that will draw on students experiences in their families and neighborhood and requires them to apply the graphing skills they are developing to confirm with evidence The teacher provides statistical information and models the development of one linear equation from the statistics then he says now you try and thats the signal for students to work individually or in small groups to develop linear equations and graph various equations As the students work the teacher walks around answering questions eavesdropping on conversations and keeping an eye out for struggling students If the teacher notices a student struggling he picks up a scaffolding document that he keeps in the document files accessible to all students gives it to the student and talks her through the process This document breaks down the steps into smaller parts to facilitate access to the learning objectives Next we visit the Main OfficeWelcome Center It is a small comfortable space as rich with information for teachers and family members as the classrooms are for students Posters about the PATH Plan and HOWL learner outcomes adorn the walls and an array of information for parents and students is displayed in multiple racks and on the corkboard handbook bell schedules calendars special education rights college career volunteer opportunities etc When we go to the Principals office there is a note on the whiteboard on her door that she is visiting science classes this period Shes in the classrooms a lot observing teachers at work engaging with students and always looking for how she can better support and improve teaching and learning at Pathways We then hear some yelling and follow the sound to the Wellness Coordinators office If we were to enter the room which would not be appropriate we would see a student who is upset holding a stress ball and rocking back and forth She is yelling and crying about another student who took her seat in class It was groupwork time and the teacher moved students around to Pathways Community School intentionally facilitate heterogeneous grouping The girl became agitated when another student sat in the seat that was assigned to her The teacher knowing the early signs of being triggered and knowing that this is a new student who has not developed selfcalming strategies asked to checkin with the girl in the hallway The girl storms out and waits in the hall The teacher directs the class to get started on the assignment and nods to the instructional aide to facilitate She stands at the doorway with the door propped open but is able to speak quietly to the student without an audience The teacher calmly and with an intentionally modulated voice identifies the students emotion for her and offers options I see that you are becoming upset do you want to return to class or would you like to meet with your Wellness Coordinator The campus aide who supervises the hallway had already noticed the teacher and student in the hallway and starts to walk up The girl is still agitated and yells yeah whatever and then goes with the campus aide who is also trained in deescalation strategies Now in the Wellness Coordinator office the Wellness Coordinator helps the student calm herself with breathing and mindfulness techniques and then they are able to identify her trigger Her family is currently homeless and doubled up with relatives where the girl has no space to herself and no access to her belongings Her school supplies which were provided to her by the school and her seats in class are the only things that she has that is hers right now The Wellness Coordinator will inform her teachers of this and work with the girl to recognize when she is being triggered and seek a safe space within the classroom where she can go to use selfcalming strategies and return to a place where she is again prepared to learn For now the Wellness Coordinator checks in with her and prepares her to return to class after calming down After leaving the office we visit a few more classes In English students are all standing and moving to parts of the room that are labeled Strongly Agree Agree Strongly Disagree Disagree based on statements provided on the projector Once the students get settled in their locations the teacher facilitates a debate where the students must argue their position and provide evidence supporting their argument In US History students are moving among stations of primary source paintings political cartoons and speeches from the Industrial Revolution to determine the perspective that each source has regarding child labor And in Entrepreneurism students are dressed nicely and presenting their Business Plan to a panel of local entrepreneurs During lunch some students sit outside at the tables others take their lunches to their classrooms for lunchtime club meetings or tutoring with their teachers It is a lively atmosphere with teenagers being loud and silly but it is respectful and you notice that students are cleaning up after themselves a culture of pride ownership and community has been cultivated here Pathways Community School Element Measurable Pupil Outcomes and Element Method by which Pupil Progress Toward Outcomes will be Measured The

Business pm Board Member Resolutions for Action Dr Rodriguez Dr Vladovic Creating a Birth to Eight Roadmap for Success in Los Angeles Res Noticed December Whereas Research has shown that children who are proficient readers in third grade are four times more likely to graduate than those who are not Whereas High quality earlylearning experiences set young learners on a pathway to future academic success Whereas In the Institute of Medicine IOM and the National Research Council NRC released a seminal report Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age A Unifying Foundation which provides a detailed blueprint for national state and local leaders to ensure that professionals working with young children are well prepared to most effectively support every childs growth and development Whereas In early First California and the California Department of Education Early Education and Support Division convened key stakeholders in the field of early care and education to engage in an intensive and robust process to consider the most relevant IOMNRC recommendations in relation to key priorities facing Californias early childhood workforce and as a result developed a plan for achieving these priorities Whereas A childs foundation built in the early years through their involvement in quality early education programs establishes a path to improved high school

others city county business community and family partners in order to create and implement the Districts Birth to Eight Roadmap for Success and present it to the Board in August Mr Melvoin LAUSDATA Los Angeles Unified Sharing Data for Accessibility Transparency and Accountability Res Noticed December Whereas Efforts to Improve student achievement in the Los Angeles Unified School District depend on the Districts and communitys ability to access and analyze current and emerging practices trends and data showing successes and challenges Whereas The District is committed to openness and transparency based on the belief that open government improves democratic functioning and fuels innovation and collective problem solving Whereas The Districts commitment aligns with and follows the lead of the City of Los Angeles which seeks to be the most open and transparent city in the United States Both the Mayors Office through its GeoHub geohublacityorg and Open Data datalacityorg websites openbudgetlacityorg and the City Controllers Office through its Control Panel LA website httpscontrollerdatalacityorg provide large amounts of open datasets for public users to download and analyze to better understand and conduct research regardings the citys operations and finances Whereas Although the District already publishes significant amounts of information via its website and in response to requests those data are not yet centralized or consistently provided in formats that can be utilized for further analysis by either stakeholders or staff Whereas Over the last several years new and emerging data practices and technology have enabled local governments including school districts to improve their transparency and accountability through open data For example New York Citys Open Data website httpsdatacityofnewyorkusbrowsecategoryEducationprovenanceofficial allows the public to search datasets by agency keyword or category and includes over datasets related to its Department of Education ranging from SAT AP and test results to detailed budget reports some of which have been accessed by the public up to times Whereas Increasing access to data empowers stakeholders to participate in governance with greater understanding and impact It fosters creative new thinking about solving our most intractable challenges like achievement and opportunity gaps early literacy English language development and college readiness through publicprivate partnerships and promoting a culture of data sharing between our own District departments and other civic resources and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Providing open data is a first step on the path towards transparent practices and to building trust and accountability in the District as a civic institution now therefore be it and Whereas Improved access to datasets and applications building upon those data sets would also enable the District to make progress towards goals like graduation literacy and numeracy for all and college and careerreadiness For example District staff and partners could benefit from data applications such as Charts showing trends in collegepersistence across time capable of being sorted by various factors such as ethnicity gender income status etc Heat maps showing locations of schools with low or high English Learner reclassification rates Tables of schools exhibiting aboveaverage growth in student achievement on CAASPP scores in the middle grades Visualizations comparing special education assessment or exit rates across local districts Graphs comparing various financial investments in historically underperforming schools with academic outcomes broken down for African American Latino or Asian and Pacific Islander students Real time data showing attendance fluctuations by school or local district compared to local investments in pupil services and attendance support and Manipulable maps showing available LAUSD early childhood education programs for all families low income families and students with disabilities now therefore be it Resolved That the Superintendent will facilitate the creation of an LAUSD Open Data Portal website that will serve as the central source for open data and will designate an Open Data Officer within the District to oversee the ongoing implementation of the portal All datasets determined to be accessible to the public shall be made available on this portal to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy confidentiality security and other legal or practical restrictions Resolved further That the District will obtain the assistance of a costeffective vendor with expertise in open government data and user experience design to in establishing the LAUSD Open Data Portal

process for publishing open data to ensure that all appropriate datasets are identified for public disclosure Datasets regarding student performance including college readiness indicators budget and finance and facilities should be prioritized for disclosure Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved further That each relevant District Division shall work with the Open Data Officer to make all appropriate data sets available online and update its public data on a frequent basis preferably automatically The Open Data Officer and Divisions shall work with community stakeholders to identifyin a continuous manneradditional data sets that are not yet available but may be of value for public review and collaboration and shall make best efforts to ensure that such

Res Noticed December Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvard trained historian like WEB DuBois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas It is commonly stated that Carter G Woodson selected February as the month to host Negro History Week because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass whose birthdays are February th and th respectively Whereas Carter G Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas The legacy of Carter G Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History ASALH an organization now in its Centennial Year Whereas The theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is African Americans in Times of War Whereas The story of America cannot be told without reflecting on places where African Americans made history in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as The Kingsley Plantation DuSables home site the numerous stops along the Underground Railroad Seneca Village Mother Bethel AME Church and Frederick Douglass home Whereas The story of the struggle for equal citizenship for African Americans can be documented by the significance of landmarks such as Mary McLeod Bethunes home in Washington DC th Street in Harlem Beale Street in Memphis and Sweet Auburn Avenue in Atlanta Whereas Black people have a history of military service in the United States that dates back to Crispus Attucks and Lemuel Haynes who both served in the American Revolutionary War Whereas Cpl Freddie Stowers was the first black Medal of Honor recipient who went above and beyond the call of duty in while serving in World War I but was honored posthumously when his family was recognized at the White House in Whereas Gen Daniel Chappie James Jr a Tuskegee Airman was the first African American to become full general and achieve four stars Whereas While their contributions are lesser known than the story of the Tuskegee Airmen the first black marines trained in a segregated unit during World War II at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and were subsequently awarded Congressional Gold Medals for their service Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Harriett Waddy was the highest ranking Black Woman in the military during World War II leading the Womens Army Corps and eventually attaining the rank of Major during wartime and retired as a lieutenant colonial in Whereas These and many other courageous Black men and women served their country with honor and fought for American freedoms we enjoy today despite being denied the dignity of integrated military service or inclusion in the very freedoms they fought for when they returned to civilian life Whereas Over the past century and a half Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community and Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black culture and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will work with educators librarians all the schools of the District and the community to recognize and celebrate this month with appropriate programs ceremonies and activities that

REQUEST FOR APPROVAL OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACTStudent ImpactThe District provides myriad centralized services to the students of LAUSD via a diverse workforce many who live a significant distance from the Beaudry HQ building This contract will provide services that allow the District to cast a wider net in the course of talent acquisition and to better retain those employees IntroductionThe proposal is to piggyback on a City of Los Angeles contract with MV Transportation Inc to provide bus service between Union Station and the Beaudry HQ building The contract would be funded from transportation subsidy funds at no additional expense to the District Why is this necessary Board action is required to improve the accessibility of the Beaudry HQ building from Union Station to encourage employees towards more sustainable modes of transportation Why do we need to do this now There is currently no direct way for commuters arriving at Union Station to travel to the Beaudry HQ building which discourages employees from green commuting If approved this service would begin February What would happen if this were not approved Employees commuting to the Beaudry HQ will continue to have a circuitous and timeconsuming route between Union Station and the Beaudry HQ building as their only option The inconvenience and significant time delay may discourage some employees from utilizing mass transit which would increase the demand for parking g Members Board of Education November Michelle King EdD Superintendent What are the terms of the proposed agreement This contract is piggybacked off of a City of Los Angeles contract with MV Transportation operators of the LADOT Commuter Express buses MV Transportation would provide service from Union Station to the Beaudry HQ building from February until April with two oneyear renewal options for a total contract capacity is The contract would be funded entirely by reducing the transit subsidy received by

District schools listed in Attachment A whichincludes K schools affiliated charter schools early education centers and California State PreschoolProgram CSPP at elementary schools was necessary due to the emergency conditions as set forth inEducation Code Section The Board of Education authorizes staff to take all necessary actions to obtain allowance of attendance from theCalifornia Department of Education CDE for the emergency closures as well as for the material decrease inattendance experienced by any school due to the emergency conditions The waiver application for emergencyclosure and material decrease in attendance may be sent to CDE at different times due to data gatheringrequirementsThe Board of Education ratifies payment of staff salaries due to emergency school closures for December and BackgroundSeveral wildfires broke out in Southern California early December three of which impacted Districtschools The Creek and Rye fires started on Tuesday December These fires resulted in the evacuation ofeleven schools and two early education centers on that day On Wednesday December the Skirball fire brokeout Fiftyfive schools and centers that were within the mandatory evacuation area declared by the Los AngelesFire Department were closed on Wednesday December As the fires continued to grow and health risks tostudents and staff increased the Superintendent deemed it necessary to close all District schools in LocalDistricts Northeast and Northwest as well as sixteen schools in Local District West for the remainder of theweekThe complete list of school closures is

Increasing Civic Learning Opportunities for LAUSD Students Res Noticed April Whereas It is the goal of the Los Angeles Unified School District to prepare all of our students for college career and community Whereas Los Angeles youth should understand that they are valued members of communities and that they have a role to play in improving and contributing to their communities Whereas Los Angeles youth can develop analytic skills and civic commitments by studying the strengths and challenges of their communities and developing evidencebased plans for community improvement Whereas Public support for democracy has been in steady decline and tolerance for autocratic alternatives is rising in the United States and around the world Whereas There has never been a better or more crucial time to revitalize civic learning in our schools Whereas Leading national researchers have identified critical inequalities in the provision of civic learning opportunities On average white students middleclass students and students in highertrack classes experience more classroombased afterschool and informal civic learning opportunities and are much more likely to be engaged in extracurricular groups that support civic development Whereas The education system has a major role in ensuring students have equitable access to learning to participate in our democracy The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF recognizes the necessity of investing in the reduction and ultimate removal of inequitable outcomes Civic learning goals are closely related to three of the states priority areas for LCFF pupil engagement school climate and other pupil outcomes Revitalizing civic learning opportunities in an equitable manner can contribute to meeting these and other goals Whereas We have much to gain by revitalizing civic learning In addition to the chief benefits of a vibrant and informed civic life and democracy high quality civic learning also helps teach children the skills they need for the st century workplace such as critical thinking collaboration creativity initiative and innovation In addition it can improve school climate and safety lower schools dropout rates and promote academic achievement aligned with the Common Core State Standards Whereas Research shows that a variety of civic learning opportunities can foster greater and more informed civic and political engagement among all youth and in particular among youth from lowincome families youth of color and immigrant youth Whereas We know how to improve civic outcomes for students There are many proven practices that directly improve the quality and effectiveness of civic learning in schools including civic action projects digital literacy education and engagement classroom instruction in government history law and democracy discussion of current events servicelearning extracurricular or cocurricular activities student voice in school governance and simulations of democratic processes Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas Even as we understand how to deepen and expand civic learning LAUSD like most districts lacks critical data on how civic learning opportunities are distributed both across and within schools Without such information the District is not able to assess its overall civic learning needs or to determine how to target necessary supports to enhance civic learning and make it more equitable Whereas LAUSD thus needs an indicator system that allows the District to assess the quality and distribution of civic learning opportunities and related civic outcomes and Whereas Leading civic education scholars have developed a researchbased indicator system for identifying and tracking high quality civic learning through the Leveraging Equity and Access in Democratic Education LEADE initiative now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District makes a commitment to expanding equity and access to highquality civic learning for all students Resolved further That the Board requests the Superintendent to direct staff to draw upon the LEADE indicator system to identify and collect relevant data on valued civic learning opportunities and outcomes in the District and create a plan for increasing these opportunities for students with special attention to students from lowincome families English Learners and other groups that have been underserved and be it finally Resolved That the Board Superintendent staff and community members will make Los Angeles civic engagement program a national model that equitably prepares all students to graduate college career and community ready Ms Ratliff Dr Rodriguez Ensuring Student Safety Res Waiver of Board Rule

might involve students sitting on synthetic turf Whereas Playground equipment made of plastics and rubbers are used by students throughout District schools Whereas As long as surfaces and playground equipment are in direct sunlight for an extended period of time there is a risk for students to sustain a thermal burn injury and Whereas Asphalt concrete synthetic turf and playground equipment get hot during warm and hot days and there is currently no policy bulletin that determines at which point either time or temperaturewise students will not be allowed to sit or continue to sit on asphalt concrete and synthetic turf or play on playground equipment now therefore be it Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby directs the Superintendent to work with our Office of Environmental Health and Safety to draft and distribute a policy bulletin within the next two weeks that clearly communicates guidance regarding safety considerations for schools related to students sitting on asphalt concrete and synthetic turf or playing on playground equipment Ms Ratliff Dr Rodriguez Mr Zimmer Galvanizing Resources to Find Missing Youth Res Waiver of Board Rule Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to student safety Whereas Occasionally the District learns that a student has been reported as missing Whereas There is sometimes a delay from the time that the District learns that a student is missing and the notification of the media Whereas The media can be a useful partner in missing youth cases as they can alert the public and help draw attention to the need to find missing youth Whereas Local government officials can also assist in locating missing youth and Whereas There is currently no District protocol or process clearly delineating when or under what circumstances the media and local government officials will be contacted for assistance in finding missing youth now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby directs the Superintendent to have appropriate staff draft and distribute a policy

competencies that are the focus of LAUSDs SEL program are growth mindset selfefficacy selfmanagement and social awareness Whereas The District has already made strong investments in SEL programs including the Harmony Project the middle grades initiatives SEL traumainformed practices the mathematical mindsets work restorative justice and current collaboration with CORE waiver schools Whereas LAUSD SEL Wellness Facilitators provide coaching and professional development to CORE waiver school site teams to develop yearlong strategic plans that address school culture and climate needs and to build the capacity of school teams to sustain the SEL work on their own Whereas Research shows that SEL programs can generate short and longterm savings to society through enhanced educational attainment and achievement including a reduced likelihood of involvement with the police due to reduced aggression crime and drug use and both decreased need for public housing assistance and social welfare programs and increased earnings due to college attainment and fulltime employment Belfield et al Karoly Jones et al Whereas The aggregate results of studies looking at six evidencebased SEL interventions show a benefitcost ratio of meaning that for every one dollar invested in SEL programs there is an average return of dollars Belfield et Whereas A national survey of over preschool through high school teachers found that percent want an increased focus of SEL in their schools Bridgeland Bruce and Hariharan Whereas Data from the Districts Spring School Quality Index Surveys revealed that for academic performance in English Language Arts schools where students scored higher overall in Social Emotional Literacy also had higher numbers of students scoring proficient and advanced in ELA performance and Whereas The June Reimagining the Middle Grades framework for action identified SEL as a key area of need for middle school students in the District and recommended the creation of a Social Emotional Barometer to acknowledge how students are feeling so that teachers can address any social emotional barriers to learning and now therefore be it Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the Social Emotional Learning initiatives in the District and asks the Division of Instruction to create an awareness campaign to deepen the practices in our local school communities and collaborate with District departments eg Beyond the Bell Special Education Student Health and Human Services Parent and Community Services and community partners to create a hub of resources and promising practices that will amplify SEL efforts for students teachers parents and community members The following speakers addressed the Board Ms Lynne Lueders Dr Rodriguez seconded the motion Dr Frances Gipson Chief Academic Officer responded to questions from Ms Ratliff regarding the

Department along with other local law enforcement agencies and other public service and community based organizations have a history of participating in this community building event held on the first Tuesday of August each year Whereas The Los Angeles School Police Department LASPD has participated in National Night Out for some years now including hosting schoolbased events for the last four years such as the two LASPD sponsored events on August at Manual Arts High School and Gardena High School where meals backpacks entertainment and other donated gifts were provided to neighborhood participants in conjunction with the support of other local law enforcement agencies colleges and universities businesses and community based organizations Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas On August Board Member Mnica Ratliff and Board District staff and Local District Northeast administrators school principals and staff joined community members and law enforcement officials for National Night Out festivities in the San Fernando Valley Whereas District schools play a vital role in promoting increased safety health and welfare in neighborhoods and communities across Los Angeles County and Whereas Increased District participation in the National Night Out annual campaign would provide a unique opportunity for schools to form deeper partnerships with local law enforcement officials as well as neighborhood businesses agencies and community based organizations to make our communities safer places for our children and families to live now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby recognize the first Tuesday of each August as National Night Out Resolved further That the Board hereby declares Tuesday August as the th annual National Night Out and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent encourages all local districts and schools to recognize and participate in local National Night Out campaigns as an opportunity to help establish safer and more united local communities for the overall health and welfare of Los Angeles Unified School District students families and staff Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Dr Rodriguez Mr Zimmer Celebrating and Affirming Our Students and Families with Pride Month Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District models advocates and promotes the inclusive and respectful treatment of all our members Whereas The California Education Code Section provides It is the policy of the State of California to afford all persons in public schools regardless of their disability gender gender identity gender expression nationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section of the Penal Code equal rights and opportunities in the educational institutions of the state Whereas The District is committed to school safety for all members including the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender QueerQuestioning LGBTQ community or those that may be perceived as such Whereas The District has a mission to reach graduation rate for all students Whereas The District has a role to provide a safe nurturing and tolerant environment in our schools Whereas The month of June is an opportunity to celebrate the identities and contributions of the LGBTQ community Whereas Sexual orientation and gender expressionbiased bullying is among the most common form of harassment in schools Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The significantly higher rates of school dropout academic failure and school disengagement among LGBTQ youth across the country are attributed in part to peer harassment and bullying Whereas Children who do not conform to gender stereotypes are more likely to be targets of harassment Whereas No one should ever be the target of bullying harassment or violence Whereas We must strive to ensure that District schools are consistently safe and affirming spaces for all students staff and their families Whereas The Human Relations Diversity and Equity division is a resource for trainings activities lessons and servicelearning projects for and about LGBTQ concerns and is committed to fostering a safe and respectful District school and community culture Whereas Project in the Educational Equity Compliance Office is a District program that oversees education and support services for LGBTQ students in order to ensure safe supportive and welcoming campuses free from discrimination and harassment for LGBTQ students and staff Whereas The District and the Los Angeles LGBT Center formed an initiative Project SPIN Suicide Prevention Intervention Now to bring systemic efforts to celebrate and support LGBTQ students families and staff Whereas The FAIR Education Act of called for positive inclusion of the contributions of LGBTQ Americans in social studies curriculum Whereas The Student Success and Opportunity Act of strengthened

families Whereas In October the District Athletic department announced its Blow the Whistle on Hate initiative to foster more respectful environments Whereas Affirming school and home environments substantially improve the mental health and school engagement of LGBTQ students Whereas By recognizing Pride Month we support policies practices and curriculum that honor and respect LGBTQ students staff and their families and Whereas By recognizing Pride Month we reaffirm our commitment to the Districts resolution Respectful Treatment of All Persons now therefore be it Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District declares June as Pride Month and directs the Superintendent and all District staff to support lessons and activities that engage students in meaningful learning research and writing about our LGBTQ students and families Ms Garca Dr Rodriguez Dr McKenna Maximizing Quality Learning Time for All Towards Graduation by Supporting SB Res Whereas To get to graduation students must be allowed to maximize on their daily right to read write learn and achieve Whereas In the Los Angeles Unified School District lost instructional days do to suspensions Whereas In the District adopted the School Climate Bill of Rights that among other milestones eliminated the use of willful defiance as a reason for student suspension Whereas Since days lost to suspensions have decreased to Whereas In AB was chaptered into law prohibiting the use of disruptiondefiance as grounds for K suspensions and K expulsions but it is scheduled to sunset on July Whereas AB resulted in a drop in defiancedisruption suspensions in elementary schools during More than suspensions of K students were prevented incentivizing school districts to adopt nonpunitive alternatives to suspensions and expulsions Whereas Students can be suspended or expelled from schools for simply refusing to take off their hat or falling asleep during a lecture These suspensions fall under the category willful defiance and often occur without consideration of the root of the students actions Whereas SB as amended a bill authored by Senator Nancy Skinner SD would amend the Education Code to address the overuse of suspensions and expulsions for minor and subjectively imposed offenses pursuant to Educ Code k Whereas Currently Section k allows students in grades to be suspended from school for disruption or defiance Neither disruption nor defiance is defined anywhere in the Education Code as such Section k is largely left to the subjective judgment of school personnel Whereas It is estimated that this category was identified as the most severe grounds for some suspensions or of all suspensions in the state during the school year Whereas New state funding has assisted schools in adopting alternatives million in the budget proposal supports a grant program to implement restorative practices and social emotional learning programs to address the root of the problem for students Whereas Research is clear that suspended and expelled students are far more likely than their peers to drop out of school and enter the juvenile delinquency system at great cost to the state Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas Research also shows that alternatives to suspension and expulsionsuch as Restorative Practices tiered interventions through Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports and social emotional learningreduce suspensions improve behavior and improve academic outcomes now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby supports the passage of California Senate Bill and directs the Superintendent to communicate with our state legislative body the need and urgency of the proposed bill and the positive outcomes that have already taken place in our District as a result of the passing of our School Climate Bill of Rights Ms Garca Reducing the Inequitable Impact of Funding Cuts for Our Highest Need Students Res Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is committed to providing all children with a worldclass education regardless of socioeconomic status or other factors and students living in material poverty are especially deserving of services to help them succeed academically Whereas The federal government has long recognized the need to provide additional resources to children living in poverty in order to advance equity in public education Whereas President Lyndon B Johnson established Title I funding in to help close the achievement gap between lowincome children and their middleclass peers Whereas More than percent of District students qualify for the federal free and reducedprice meal program a measurement used to determine Title I eligibility Whereas A million reduction in the Districts Title I allocation in prompted the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District to raise the eligibility threshold from to percent in order to shift more money to the highestpoverty schools Whereas The District currently distributes Title I revenue using a twotiered system which in allocated per student for schools with lowincome enrollments of percent and per student for schools with percent or more lowincome students Whereas The District anticipates a reduction in Title I funding from million in to million or a reduction of million in Whereas In response to this anticipated reduction the District reduced Title I allocations for at all schools by approximately resulting in cuts of approximately per student at schools with of lowincome students and per student at schools with lowincome students Whereas This reduction caused schools serving the largest population of lowincome students to have the largest dollar drop in Title I funding with many schools losing hundreds of thousands of dollars Whereas Local school boards are empowered to determine how to distribute Title I resources to eligible campuses which are those with lowincome enrollments of at least percent and Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The District has prioritized in its strategic plan a commitment to excellence high expectations equity and access to ensure academic achievement and empower tomorrows leaders which requires the highest need students receive an equitable amount of support now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to report back in days with an analysis of how financial shifts at the state and federal level will affect school site funding and will articulate a plan for raising the amount of Title I funding on per student basis for schools with lowincome enrollments of at least beginning in the school year Resolved further That beginning in the school year the Title investment strategy that will keep the eligibility threshold at but will include a tier system percent tier tier and an to percent tier financial formula that is based on a newly developed equity formula Resolved further That the Superintendent also analyze the carryover or surplus from all parts of the Districts budget in fiscal year and explore other possible strategies such as using Targeted Student Population funds or additional funding beyond what is currently anticipated to hold schools over the Title threshold financially harmless in the school year and be it finally Resolved Any future cuts made by the District to the tiers of Title designated schools will be done with a priority to minimize funding reductions for schools with lowincome enrollment exceeding understanding that equity demands that schools serving the greatest concentration of need be given our greatest support PUBLIC COMMENT The following speakers addressed the Board on the subjects indicated Ms Enoe Tran Parent Colocation Mr Vernon Dayton Teacher JROTC Mr Robert Huntly

District staff first engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA District staff evaluated space at the District school sites andor in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School School Management Services SMS provided data that indicated and District staff determined no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for example for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking Walking or biking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Active transportation walking biking or rolling to school can help increase physical activity levels of students and their families CAHealth Incorporating Safe Routes to School into Local School Wellness Policies June Physical activity reduces the risk of obesity and related chronic diseases and also improves mental health attendance and academic performance Ibid Active transportation can also have broad community benefits including reducing traffic congestion and air pollution creating safer streets encouraging cost savings and building a stronger sense of community Ibid Increasing physical activity through walking and biking to school can help address high obesity rates Ibid Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores steadily increased In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education In the Districts overall API score increased by points to outpacing nearly all urban school districts in In March the State Board of Education SBE decided to not calculate the API for local educational agencies and schools for the and academic years As a result and API reports were not produced The SBE and the California Department of Education CDE are in the process of developing a new accountability system to replace the API to measure the States educational goals Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Growth API LEA Report CA Department of Education API scores for students with disabilities improved by points and economically disadvantaged students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small

student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts

or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias

area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools

by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores steadily increased In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education In the Districts overall API score increased by points to outpacing nearly all urban school districts in In March the State Board of Education SBE decided to not calculate the API for local educational agencies and schools for the and academic years As a result and API reports were not produced The SBE and the California Department of Education CDE are in the process of developing a new accountability system to replace the API to measure the States educational goals Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Growth API LEA Report CA Department of Education API scores for students with disabilities improved by points and economically disadvantaged students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School

Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have

classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels

safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board

unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores steadily increased In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California

SBE decided to not calculate the API for local educational agencies and schools for the and academic years As a result and API reports were not produced The SBE and the California Department of Education CDE are in the process of developing a new accountability system to replace the API to measure the States educational goals Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Growth API LEA Report CA Department of Education API scores for students with disabilities improved by points and economically disadvantaged students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more

space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by

Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers

advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores steadily increased In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education In the Districts overall API score increased by points to outpacing nearly all urban school districts in In March the State Board of Education SBE decided to not calculate the API for local educational agencies and schools for the and academic years As a result and API reports were not produced The SBE and the California Department of Education CDE are in the process of developing a new accountability system to replace the API to measure the States educational goals Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain

interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See

basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach

Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school

Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to

at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement

Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for example for

assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels

physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School

distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can

predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education

where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract

Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the

schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved

To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking Walking

Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which

that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school

Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study

Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School

Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for

integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after

to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by

purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to

determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues

Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily

Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to their local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education

at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for example for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels

physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School

that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to

distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several

educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas The District can make a complete and contiguous multisite offer to accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA therefore be it Resolved That pursuant to California Code

in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the

setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking Walking or biking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Active transportation walking biking or rolling to school can

obesity and related chronic diseases and also improves mental health attendance and academic performance Ibid Active transportation can also have broad community benefits including reducing traffic congestion and air pollution creating safer streets encouraging cost savings and building a stronger sense of community Ibid Increasing physical activity through walking and biking to school can help address high obesity rates Ibid Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school

eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas The District can make a complete and contiguous multisite offer to accommodate Charter Schools entire

in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for example for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking Walking or biking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Active transportation walking biking or rolling to school can help increase physical activity levels of students and their families CAHealth Incorporating Safe Routes to

Active transportation can also have broad community benefits including reducing traffic congestion and air pollution creating safer streets encouraging cost savings and building a stronger sense of community Ibid Increasing physical activity through walking and biking to school can help address high obesity rates Ibid Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores steadily increased In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA

neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District

indicated and District staff determined no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School set asides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help lowachieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally school setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinA School is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August At the middle school level School setasides are used for example for Personal Learning Environment PLE

multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs For example these setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the

with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Department of Public Health DPH close to onethird of Californias children are overweight or obese The DPHs California Active Communities CAC in collaboration with CAHealth a project of the Public Health Institute with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that a childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking Walking or biking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to

Increasing physical activity through walking and biking to school can help address high obesity rates Ibid Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to

barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school CAHealth the CAC and the DPH support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a singlesite offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus for District students The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from their neighborhood school Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January According to the Los Angeles Police Department the District is located within the territory known as the gang capital of the nation with more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the potential for further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicago Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January campaigntoprovidesafepassageonwaytoschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Process and Matching Guidelines District Staff Followed to Locate Space for Charter Schools Pursuant to Proposition The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible in District charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus for the school year The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline This year the District continues to utilize its new capacity assessment determination in an improved process that is now called Electronic Capacity Assessment Review ECAR As it did last year ECAR encompassed school sites throughout the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks principals at over District campuses utilized a comprehensive web based application to specifically identify and validate classroom space utilized as teaching stations and set asides along with classroom numbers locations and sizes Additionally they identified Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January classrooms occupied by special education programs charter schools preschools adult education programs and other third party users swing space needed for construction projects options programs and other classrooms out of service or mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows Since the beginning of August SMS staff has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is ECAR The purpose of ECAR is to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity ECAR entails a detailed review of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis includes reporting of data by individual schools which is analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly evaluated throughout the District ECAR commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools in the previous year for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level and specific course subject matters at secondary schools The ECAR process involves school principals logging into a web based application to review and confirm their schools enrollment and review and confirm details regarding the school sites classrooms and their respective utilization Within this application classroom data is associated with a spatial database that is displayed as building floor plans Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January To ensure that the principal provides the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity they are instructed to reference the following resource materials for their school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the current or most recent Norm Day classification report for any magnet center andor Dual Language Program associated with the school the Classroom Inventory and Allocation pages from the prior school years Capacity Assessment Review report on which is the information for classroom counts and allocation into preciselydefine categories and the number of teachers at the school and identification of those who are assigned to Special Education PreK andor Physical Education as applicable Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing District staff reviewed data from SMS regarding specific capacity information at District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as set asides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and charter school pre kindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of

Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas District staff determined that data from School Management Services SMS indicated no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas The District can make a complete and contiguous multisite offer to accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA therefore be it Resolved That pursuant to California Code of Regulations title section subdivision d for the reasons set forth herein and as further expressed by District staff the Governing Board Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January of the Los Angeles Unified School District finds that the District cannot accommodate Charter School at a single school site and therefore be it finally Resolved That pursuant to Education Code sections and California Code of Regulations title section et seq for the reasons set forth herein and as further expressed by District staff the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District authorizes a preliminary proposal andor offer of facilities to Charter School for the Next Fiscal Year at multiple District school sites Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January

Angeles Res Noticed December Whereas Research has shown that children who are proficient readers in third grade are four times more likely to graduate than those who are not ADOPTED BY CONSENT VOTE Whereas High quality earlylearning experiences set young learners on a pathway to future academic success Whereas In the Institute of Medicine IOM and the National Research Council NRC released a seminal report Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age A Unifying Foundation which provides a detailed blueprint for national state and local leaders to ensure that professionals working with young children are well prepared to most effectively support every childs growth and development Whereas In early First California and the California Department of Education Early Education and Support Division convened key stakeholders in the field of early care and education to engage in an intensive and robust process to consider the most relevant IOMNRC recommendations in relation to key priorities facing Californias early childhood workforce and as a result developed a plan for achieving these priorities Whereas A childs foundation built in the early years through their involvement in quality early education programs establishes a path to improved high school graduation rates while reducing the risks of criminal involvement Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School Districts Strategic Plan recognizes building a solid foundation for early learners as a key objective in order to reach its goal of graduation Whereas The Division of Early Childhood Education has implemented a new California State Preschool Learning Foundations aligned curriculum resulting in the improvement in the number of students who score benchmark in the Desired Results Developmental Profile assessment Whereas The Districts Early Language and Literacy Plan ELLP has resulted in ELLP schools improvement in the percentage of students who score benchmark and above on the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills assessment Whereas The District is building upon its College Promise to include a Primary Promise creating a Prekindergarten through college pathway through the Campaign for Grade Level Reading to address determinants of early school success while assuring ongoing partnership through the LA Compact Whereas Other school districts across the country have made significant progress and in some cases have seen successful outcomes toward creating and implementing an earlylearning and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm literacy roadmap including Bostons Thrive in and Denver and Detroits Birth to Roadmap and Whereas Members of the Districts Early Childhood Committee identified early literacy and the creation of a birth to eight initiative as a priority in order to build a solid foundation for early learners now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent and Division of Early Childhood Education to organize a steering committee that includes among others city county business community and family partners in order to create and implement the Districts Birth to Eight Roadmap for Success and present it to the Board in August Mr Melvoin Dr Vladovic LAUSDATA Los Angeles Unified Sharing Data for Accessibility Transparency and Accountability Res Noticed December Whereas Efforts to Improve student achievement in the Los Angeles Unified School District depend on the Districts and communitys ability to access and analyze current and emerging practices trends and data showing successes and challenges ADOPTED Whereas The District is committed to openness and transparency based on the belief that open government improves democratic functioning and fuels innovation and collective problem solving Whereas The Districts commitment aligns with and follows the lead of the City of Los Angeles which seeks to be the most open and transparent city in the United States Both the Mayors Office through its GeoHub geohublacityorg and Open Data datalacityorg websites and the City Controllers Office through its Control Panel LA website httpscontrollerdatalacityorg provide large amounts of open datasets for public users to download and analyze to better understand and conduct research regarding the citys operations and finances Whereas Although the District already publishes significant amounts of information via its website and in response to requests those data are not yet centralized or consistently provided in formats that can be utilized for further analysis by either stakeholders or staff Whereas Over the last several years new and emerging data practices and technology have enabled local governments including school districts to improve their transparency and accountability through open data For example New York Citys Open Data website httpsdatacityofnewyorkusbrowsecategoryEducationprovenanceofficial allows the public to search datasets by agency keyword or category and includes over datasets related to its Department of Education ranging from SAT AP and test results to detailed budget reports some of which have been accessed by the public up to times Whereas Increasing access to data empowers stakeholders to participate in governance with greater understanding and impact It fosters creative new thinking about solving our most intractable challenges like achievement and opportunity gaps early literacy English language development and college readiness through publicprivate partnerships and promoting a culture of data sharing between our own District departments and other civic resources Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Providing open data is a first step on the path towards transparent practices and to building trust and accountability in the District as a civic institution and Whereas Improved access to datasets and applications building upon those data sets would also enable the District to make progress towards goals like graduation literacy and numeracy for all and college and careerreadiness For example District staff and partners could benefit from data applications such as Charts showing trends in collegepersistence across time capable of being sorted by various factors such as ethnicity gender income status etc Heat maps showing locations of schools with low or high English Learner reclassification rates Tables of schools exhibiting aboveaverage growth in student achievement on CAASPP scores in the middle grades Visualizations comparing special education assessment or exit rates across local districts Graphs comparing various financial investments in historically underperforming schools with academic outcomes broken down for African American Latino or Asian and Pacific Islander students Real time data showing attendance fluctuations by school or local district compared to local investments in pupil services and attendance support and Manipulable maps showing available LAUSD early childhood education programs for all families low income families and students with disabilities now therefore be it Resolved That the Superintendent will facilitate the creation of an LAUSD Open Data Portal website that will serve as the central source for open data and will designate an Open Data Officer within the District to oversee the ongoing implementation of the portal All datasets shall be made available on this portal to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy confidentiality security and other legal or practical restrictions Resolved further In establishing the LAUSD Open Data Portal the District will utilize industry best practices such as the Open Data Policy Guidelines published by the Sunlight Foundation httpssunlightfoundationcomopendataguidelines the Open Data Field Guide published by Socrata httpssocratacomopendatafieldguide or the Open Data Guide published by Open Data Handbook httpopendatahandbookorgguideen Resolved further That the Open Data Officer will promptly establish an Open Data Policy which will include a process for publishing open data to ensure that all appropriate datasets are identified for public disclosure Datasets regarding student performance including college readiness indicators budget and finance and facilities should be prioritized for disclosure Resolved further That each relevant District Division shall work with the Open Data Officer to make all appropriate data sets available online and update its public data on a frequent basis preferably automatically The Open Data Officer and Divisions shall work with community stakeholders to identifyin a continuous manneradditional data sets that are not yet available but may be of value for public review and collaboration and shall make best efforts to ensure that such data be identified and shared Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolved further That the LAUSD Open Data Policy shall also ensure that Datasets are shared in a secure fashion consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA and other applicable laws to ensure that student privacy is not compromised Datasets are centralized and easy to locate Datasets are downloadable machine readable and processable and where appropriate provided in a nonstatic format or in languages other than English Datasets are searchable using common sense search terminology and A mechanism is established for users to suggest datasets for release Resolved further That the Open Data Officer will collaborate with relevant District staff to take proactive efforts to increase awareness of open datasets establish useful easytounderstand applications employing these datasets such as dashboards maps infographics or interactive online tools and collaborate with local entities civicminded software developers universities startups nonprofits civic organizations etc to experiment with new technologies visualizations and applications with the goal of identifying costeffective solutions to improve our schools Resolved further That the Open Data Portal will be established and available to the public within days of passage of this Resolution providing access to an initial set of datasets and applications using those datasets to enhance their accessibility and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will report to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District on the status of the Districts open data efforts every days through a written informative including an analysis of what data sets are being frequently accessed and whether data sets that do not yet exist are being requested and identifying what applications have been developed and promoted to ensure that the data can become useful tools for the community Dr McKenna Ms Gonez Mr Melvoin Dr Vladovic Dr Rodriguez Mr Schmerelson Celebration of Black History Month Res Noticed December Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history ADOPTED BY CONSENT VOTE Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvard trained historian like WEB DuBois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas It is commonly stated that Carter G Woodson selected February as the month to host Negro History Week because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass whose birthdays are February th and th respectively Whereas Carter G Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race not simply as the Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas The legacy of Carter G Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History ASALH an organization now in its Centennial Year Whereas The theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is African Americans in Times of War Whereas Black people have a history of military service in the United States that dates back to Crispus Attucks and Lemuel Haynes who both served in the American Revolutionary War Whereas Cpl Freddie Stowers was the first black Medal of Honor recipient who went above and beyond the call of duty in while serving in World War I but was honored posthumously when his family was recognized at the White House in Whereas Gen Daniel Chappie James Jr a Tuskegee Airman was the first African American to become full general and achieve four stars Whereas While their contributions are lesser known than the story of the Tuskegee Airmen the first black marines trained in a segregated unit during World War II at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and were subsequently awarded Congressional Gold Medals for their service Whereas Harriett Waddy was the highest ranking Black Woman in the military during World War II leading the Womens Army Corps and eventually attaining the rank of Major during wartime and retired as a lieutenant colonial in Whereas These and many other courageous Black men and women served their country with honor and fought for American freedoms we enjoy today despite being denied the dignity of integrated military service or inclusion in the very freedoms they fought for when they returned to civilian life Whereas Over the past century and a half Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community and Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black History Month Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all people of the United States are beneficiaries of the wealth of history given to all by Black culture and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will work with educators librarians all the schools of the District and the

ability to access and analyze current and emerging practices trends and data showing successes and challenges Whereas The District is committed to openness and transparency based on the belief that open government improves democratic functioning and fuels innovation and collective problem solving Whereas The Districts commitment aligns with and follows the lead of the City of Los Angeles which seeks to be the most open and transparent city in the United States Both the Mayors Office through its GeoHub geohublacityorg and Open Data datalacityorg websites and the City Controllers Office through its Control Panel LA website httpscontrollerdatalacityorg provide large amounts of open datasets for public users to Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm download and analyze to better understand and conduct research regarding the citys operations and finances Whereas Although the District already publishes significant amounts of information via its website and in response to requests those data are not yet centralized or consistently provided in formats that can be utilized for further analysis by either stakeholders or staff Whereas Over the last several years new and emerging data practices and technology have enabled local governments including school districts to improve their transparency and accountability through open data For example New York Citys Open Data website httpsdatacityofnewyorkusbrowsecategoryEducationprovenanceofficial allows the public to search datasets by agency keyword or category and includes over datasets related to its Department of Education ranging from SAT AP and test results to detailed budget reports some of which have been accessed by the public up to times Whereas Increasing access to data empowers stakeholders to participate in governance with greater understanding and impact It fosters creative new thinking about solving our most intractable challenges like achievement and opportunity gaps early literacy English language development and college readiness through publicprivate partnerships and promoting a culture of data sharing between our own District departments and other civic resources Whereas Providing open data is a first step on the path towards transparent practices and to building trust and accountability in the District as a civic institution and Whereas Improved access to datasets and applications building upon those data sets would also enable the District to make progress towards goals like graduation literacy and numeracy for all and college and careerreadiness For example District staff and partners could benefit from data applications such as Charts showing trends in collegepersistence across time capable of being sorted by various factors such as ethnicity gender income status etc Heat maps showing locations of schools with low or high English Learner reclassification rates Tables of schools exhibiting aboveaverage growth in student achievement on CAASPP scores in the middle grades Visualizations comparing special education assessment or exit rates across local districts Graphs comparing various financial investments in historically underperforming schools with academic outcomes broken down for African American Latino or Asian and Pacific Islander students Real time data showing attendance fluctuations by school or local district compared to local investments in pupil services and attendance support and Manipulable maps showing available LAUSD early childhood education programs for all families low income families and students with disabilities now therefore be it Resolved That the Superintendent will facilitate the creation of an LAUSD Open Data Portal website that will serve as the central source for open data and will designate an Open Data Officer within the District to oversee the ongoing implementation of the portal All datasets shall be made available on this portal to the extent permitted by law and subject to valid privacy confidentiality security and other legal or practical restrictions Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved further In establishing the LAUSD Open Data Portal the District

Open Data Policy which will include a process for publishing open data to ensure that all appropriate datasets are identified for public disclosure Datasets regarding student performance including college readiness indicators budget and finance and facilities should be prioritized for disclosure Resolved further That each relevant District Division shall work with the Open Data Officer to make all appropriate data sets available online and update its public data on a frequent basis preferably automatically The Open Data Officer and Divisions shall work with community stakeholders to identifyin a continuous manneradditional data sets that are not yet available but may be of value for public review and collaboration and shall make best efforts to ensure that such data be identified and shared Resolved further That the LAUSD Open Data Policy shall also ensure that Datasets are shared in a secure fashion consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA and other applicable laws to ensure that student privacy is not compromised Datasets are centralized and easy to locate Datasets are downloadable machine readable and processable and where appropriate provided in a nonstatic format or in languages other than English Datasets are searchable using common sense search terminology and A mechanism is established for users to suggest datasets for release Resolved further That the Open Data Officer will collaborate with relevant District staff to take proactive efforts to increase awareness of open datasets establish useful easytounderstand applications employing these datasets such as dashboards maps infographics or interactive online tools and collaborate with local entities civicminded software developers universities startups nonprofits civic organizations etc to experiment with new technologies visualizations and applications with the goal of identifying costeffective solutions to improve our schools Resolved further That the Open Data Portal will be established and available to the public within days of passage of this Resolution providing access to an initial set of datasets and applications using those datasets to enhance their accessibility and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will report to the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District on the status of the Districts open data

among others city county business community and family partners in order to create and implement the Districts Birth to Eight Roadmap for Success and present it to the Board in August Dr McKenna Ms Gonez Mr Melvoin Dr Vladovic Dr Rodriguez Mr Schmerelson Celebration of Black History Month Res Noticed December Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in United States history Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvard trained historian like WEB DuBois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas It is commonly stated that Carter G Woodson selected February as the month to host Negro History Week because it encompasses the birthdays of two great Americans who played Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm a prominent role in shaping black history namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass whose birthdays are February th and th respectively Whereas Carter G Woodson believed that history was created by great people and not simply great men he envisioned the study and celebration of Black people as a race not simply as the producers of great men and emphasized the contributions of countless Black men and women who contributed to the advancement of human civilization Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every United States President has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas The legacy of Carter G Woodson lives on in the continued work of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History

the highest ranking Black Woman in the military during World War II leading the Womens Army Corps and eventually attaining the rank of Major during wartime and retired as a lieutenant colonel in Whereas These and many other courageous Black men and women served their country with honor and fought for American freedoms we enjoy today despite being denied the dignity of integrated military service or inclusion in the very freedoms they fought for when they returned to civilian life Whereas Over the past century and a half Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community and Board of Education Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing

urban school districts in the nation therefore in light of its past record of progress we believe that it can and must do even more to keep pace with change Many of our schools are not yet performing to the high academic standards we expect them to meet Our diverse vibrant student population reflecting Houstons international standing is an asset We must ensure that every student regardless of culture ethnicity language or economic status has both equal opportunity and equal access to highquality education evidenced through results of growth and accountability ratings That promise is based on the beliefs that The overall studentachievement level must be improved so that after each school year every student makes at a minimum one year of instructional progress There can be no achievement gap between socioeco nomic groups andor children of ethnic diversity Recruitment and retention of highly effective teach ers are the keys to enhancing the quality of education and increasing student achievement The dropout rate is unacceptably high and must be reduced Our schools must be able to earn autonomy The level of meaningful parental engagement must be increased The community has a legitimate voice in reform and responsiveness to community concerns must be improved for performance Offers school choice while ensuring equity of resources Values and cultivates the knowledge and skills of personnel Seeks meaningful engagement with the community in all major decisions It will require an unwavering commitment to a shared course of action to make our beliefs and visions a reality Above all the results of all reform must have a positive impact on the important relationship between the teacher and the student MAnDAtE FOR CHAnGE I HISDs greatest strength is its human capital The personal facetoface contact between teacher and child will always be the central event in education Changes in the districts structure governance and policies underscore the importance of this relationship that is through reform they exist to support the relationship In addition HISD sets high expectations for school leadership to inspire creative think ing and innovative approaches that lead to instructional and operational excellence Employees identified as high performers by using value added data should be rewarded HISD must establish levels of compensation and differentiated salaries driven by performance valueadded data and accountability for all employees Reform measures must focus on higher standards for recruit ment and selection job performance and compensation and professional development and career planning and pro vide employees viable career paths within the organization II Schools must be empowered to develop and implement the methods that best achieve their unique and individual instructional goals HISD is fully committed to a decentral ized system of schools giving principals the authority over the educational and operational systems In such a system the Board of Education remains accountable to the public for highquality educational services for all children The board provides guidance and support to schools by establishing clear consistent districtwide goals high standards and expectations and effective systems of evaluation but the individual school is held accountable for innovation and instructional results within those districtwide parameters Principals are the leaders of the decisionmaking process HISD must be proactive in the early identification of affecting their schools and their leadership is measured not only by results but also by their collaboration with teachers parents and the community schools that may have too few students enrolled to provide adequate resources The district must be ready to provide the school with appropriate interventions Recognizing that schools are where decisions should be made and that successful decentralization is a function of leadership capacity at the school level the district will establish a tiered system of differentiated autonomy focus ing on instructional competencies budgets and business operational systems Schools demonstrating higher levels of student performance innovation and operational excellence including school safety are further empowered with greater autonomy and decisionmaking flexibility However other schools may need greater support and guidance and until they reach acceptable levels of performance the district must manage for them critical areas such as curriculum professional development and operational systems When guidance over decisionmaking is needed structured interventions will help develop the competencies toward greater autonomy Annual performance monitoring of instruction operations and attractiveness to the commu nity served will determine the level of principal autonomy or centraloffice intervention at the school III School choice must remain an integral part of the HISD system School choice ignites the spirit of competition motivates excellence promotes innovation and empowers parents to match their children with the schools that best meet their childrens needs It is important for HISD to focus more on developing improving and using innovative educational tools so that every child at every school has access to the in structional program that best suits his or her unique interests Equal access to instructional excellence requires adequate and equitable allocation of resources That in turn requires fair funding formulas For decades HISD has been a district of choice and a system of schools rather than a school system where every campus offers the same programs HISD will offer a portfolio of schools to meet the needs of its diverse community of students All schools whether they are specialty Magnet or neighborhood will be account able to identified educational and programmatic standards including a common core of academic subjects approved by the administration and the Board of Education All students are expected to meet those standards Achievement gaps between student groups are unacceptable Closing achievement gaps requires unequal resources for unequal needs Weighted funding allocations address indi vidual differences allowing the money to follow the child in accordance with his or her unique instructional needs and thereby ensuring access to the resources that enhance student achievement IV Meaningful engagement is defined as actively listen ing to constructive input collecting and exchanging information and sharing outcomes The Board of Educa tion understands and appreciates the need for constructive engagement with both the community and district employees and will aggressively solicit their opinions and ideas without relinquishing its responsibility as an elected body As a pub licly funded entity HISD must maintain open and respectful relationships both internally and externally and be a model for a serviceoriented culture Schools belong to the people communities will be engaged in the decisionmaking process Everyone in HISD including the board and the superin tendent shall be responsive to the districts diverse com munities Consistent meaningful twoway communication with those who support the district as well as those with differing philosophies is essential to establishing public trust and confidence HISD shall provide parents and the public and where appropriate students with formal structured systems for input into decisionmaking that sets high achievement standards for all children All employees shall be encouraged to play a more active visible role in representing the district to the community tHE CHAnGE PROCESS For nearly two decades the Houston Independent School Districts Board of Education has been guided successfully by an uncompromising statement of its beliefs and its visions for improving education in Houston We the Board of Education will continue to move the district forward We will work openly and creatively with administrators teachers parents and community leaders to put into action this new mandate for change Change is essential if we are to make our childrens education our very highest priority We alone cannot effect school reform and we alone cannot simply demand it As our predecessors clearly understood meaningful improvement is not a topdown exercise It must include and involve every one at all levels of the organization and the community We pledge to seek input and ownership by those who will be most affected by reform and restructuring in HISD and we will guide the superintendent to ensure that HISD is collab orative on issues of such importance to the entire community This is a solemn pledge and it is a privilege to accept this great responsibility on behalf of the children of Houston Houston Independent School District PURPOSE The Houston Independent School District exists to strengthen the social and economic foundation of Houston by assuring its

Godon a good day Atlantabased superintendent recruiter as quoted in the New York Times The herosuperintendent is an ideal seldom realized The whole governance structure is tilted against strong executive leadership From School Boards a report by Paul Hill OVERVIEW Just what should the public expect from the leadership at the school district level Why does it seem to be eternally controversial in many places especially in urban districts What difference could achieving the right fit between superintendents and school boards make in the learning of children Currently most of the attention on reforming schools boards can be explored with more than anecdotes focuses on classrooms The reasoning is that dedicated well and war stories qualified teachers can boost student achievement despite the chaos swirling outside their classroom doors Ideally they work under a principal who provides them with the right mix of support and autonomy School reform ultimately has to happen in the class room says Paul Hill acting dean of the Daniel J Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington But the odds that youre going to get spontaneous improvement Reform efforts that rely solely on the work of individual in the classroom without changing the broader regulatory teachers or even exemplary principals however are not environment are pretty low Classrooms are the way they are enough For most of the past two decades of change in in large part because of what happens at the district level K education researchers and policymakers also have That point is not always appreciated by the public or in acknowledged the importance of the system the district reporting about schools The public and parents probably and the state to moving reforms ahead Systemic

years states knowledge base about what makes for good district lead have tended to make an endrun around districts and deal ership is expanding The quality of leadership provided directly with school

E C T I V E B O A R D S A TRADITION on Trial T his questioning of the role of local leadership has not always existed For most of the history of K education in this coun try school boards enjoyed close ties with parents and smooth relationships with superintend ents In the early history of the education system families and neighbors banded together to pay for the education of their children In the early s they agreed to pay taxes for the education of all children in a community provided control remained in local hands School committees then boards were created to make important decisions When the number of schools began to grow school committees organized into districts or county systems The role of administrator grew from principal teacher for each school hence the term principal to an overall administrator the superintendent The role of the superintendent during the early years of districts and county systems was almost entirely instructional and tightly controlled by the school committees Some education leaders particularly Horace Mann and Henry Barnard argued for even greater centralization especially in the cities partly to wrest control of schools away from ward politics This was accom plished by the early s Centralized city school boards were run more like corporate boards of directors with report on the role of local school boards In nonurban areas school districts adopted the same management model but the smallness of most schools and districts kept the organization more personal Even though consolidation of schools and districts began in the s at the middle of the th century there still were almost separate school districts in this country each usually with at least five school board members Today there are fewer than districts the National School Boards Association claims more than members a far cry from the several hundred thousand citizens involved in schools when there board members responsible for setting overall policy and professional superin tendents resembling corporate chief What you have are traditional superintendentrun districts with supportive school boards working very much in the background and a strong community consensus to keep it going Theyre getting good results and its because of the quality of the district leadership Mike Kirst Stanford University administrative officers responsible for the districts daytoday operation

Education Commission of the States survey of superintendents conducted by Thomas Glass University of Memphis professional managers Sometimes this works Sometimes the arrangement is so controversial that some policymak ers researchers and members of the public are calling for new structures Dissatisfaction with the way many local school districts are governed by an elected school board and an appointed or elected superintendent runs deep In fact percent of super intendents judged to be outstanding by their peers and polled by the Education Commission of the States said the model needs to be seriously restructured although they did not specify how it should change Another percent called for the model to be replaced A national survey by Public Agenda found that nearly seven of superintendents say their boards interfere where they shouldnt and twothirds believe too many school boards would rather hire a superintendent they can control Yet despite the dissatisfaction with the school boardsuperintendent model Michael Kirst Stanford University education professor says it can be effective Of course it can work says Kirst There are districts School Board presidents say system

Beach and Elk Grove Calif as examples What you have are traditional superintend entrun districts with supportive school boards working very much in the background and a strong community consensus to keep it going says Kirst Theyre getting good results and its because of the quality of the district leadership E F F E C T I V E S U P E R I N T E N D E N T S E F F E C T I V E B O A R D S What is EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP T he heightened interest in school district leadership comes at a time when demands on local school leaders superintendents and school boards have never been greater This at a time when the majority face budget shortages growing numbers of atrisk students and federal and state man dates frequently unfunded that determine much of what happens in the classroom The need for enlightened policymaking stretches the capacities of school boards which are after all voluntary jobs Except in urban districts board members rarely receive compensation At the same time super intendents are expected to be efficient managers and instructional leaders The issues at the district level are more demanding than ever District leaders must distribute resources according to equity and fairness with out alienating major constituencies They must be good data analyzers They must push good practice and eliminate what isnt working They determine how capacities to deliver highquality instruction can be boosted The federal No Child Left Behind legislation has placed specific deadlines on district leadership for getting all of these things done in ways that assure that all children achieve at high levels District leaders are under pressure to align local standards for teaching and learning with state standards The federal law makes school district leadership trans parent The public must be informed regularly of progress under the Acts requirements All of this points to a more urgent need than ever to clarify just what defines an effective superintendent and effective board and how their roles and responsibilities can mesh so that entire districts perform at the levels demanded Effective Superintendents Effective superintendents according to Mike Kirst have a vision of what good instruction is and know how to execute programs that will improve teaching and learning Its not about getting a bond issue passed Its about improving classroom instruction Still research on superintendent effective ness remains sparse and leaves much to be desired says Janet Thomas a researcher with the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University Studies of the role of school districts chief executive offi cers she adds offer vague suggestions of effective leadership characteristics and have not linked leadership styles to district or student performance One study however made a connection between attributes of super intendents and improvement of student test scores George Petersen of the University of Missouri collected data from superintendents school boards and principals in five California districts that had the largest percentile growth on state assessments in the late s they were midsized districts with to students The superintendents showed instructional leadership by cid articulating a vision for childrens education and weaving that vision into the mission of the districts cid organizing support for that vision through personnel moves shared decision making board member involvement and use of key instructional strategies and cid evaluating and assessing personnel and programs All of the superintendents in the study were highly visible in their dis tricts visiting classrooms regularly and reporting their observations to princi pals They kept the focus on the dis tricts goals for students putting a high premium on intensive staff develop ment that supported the goals Petersen also found an organizational structure supporting the superintendents leader ship The superintendents could replace principals and other administrators the districts had fiscal stability and the school boards gave the superintendents latitude to make decisions The new and unfamiliar challenges facing public education today require school leaders to be flexible and col laborative rather than authoritative says Ron Heifetz founding director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvards Kennedy School of Government Authority relationships function beautifully until the environ ment changes But confronting complex and often unanticipated problems calls for flexible thinking collaboration and shared decision making Broadbased leadership can also help districts maintain the impe tus for reform even in districts experi encing high rates of superintendent andor school board turnover And the more people who are involved in formulating a districts reform agenda the more people there are with a stake in its success Heifetz says Paul Houston executive director of the American Association of School Administrators summarizes the changing roles and expectations of superintendents this way Superintendents once were considered successful if they could manage the Bs of district leadership buildings

orientation for new board members no investment in training for board members All about improving student achievement of all students Unfocused agenda that wastes time on unimportant peripheral issues

like connection communication collaboration community building child advocacy and curricular choices that lead to academic progress for all children Managing The Politics The current clamor may be for instructional leadership but district leaders also must effectively manage change in highly complex politically charged and often contentious system If they are to survive and thrive in their role as superintendents they need to understand and be adept at the politics of these jobs A former superintendent Houston contends most of his colleagues enjoy their work and find it challenging Still there is much about the current role that is dysfunctional he says Expectations and resources are mis matched Accountability and authority are misaligned The work is now con ducted in an environment that over time has grown increasingly political and downright abusive A study commissioned by ECS found that of superintendents sur veyed believe the superintendency itself is in a state of crisis characterized by poor school boardsuperintendent relations long working hours and stressful working conditions Some former superintendents explain why Ronald Ross who served as superin tendent for four years in Mt Vernon NY was always walking a tightrope having to play politics Now a senior fellow at the National Urban League he retired primarily because of the major reason for superintendent turnover a poor relationship with his school board Spence Korte resigned in the summer of after three years in the Milwaukee superintendency out of frustration with a politically fractured school board The reality is you have to think about urban schools within a context thats largely political says Korte The dissension makes it impossible for leaders to be effective Other superintendents see negotiat ing the political complexities of a school board as part of the job Pascal Pat Forgione superintendent of the Austin Texas school district attributes his success in earning the superinten dency to his willingness to campaign for it School leaders must be political players he says Leadership has to be effective within a political context according to Forgione who is Austins seventh superintendent in years You have to design your leadership for your districts politics Effective School Boards If many school superintendents urban in particular are working under stress so are many school boards Although still vested with financial oversight and policymaking authority todays board members are far less responsive to local community values than their predecessors according to Jim Cibulka dean of the School of Education at the University of Kentucky Especially in large districts local control has been eroded by a com bination of voter apathy and growing state and federal influence over school issues Cibulka says Board members also lack sufficient information or are too divided politically to effectively set E F F E C T I V E S U P E R I N T E N D E N T S E F F E C T I V E B O A R D S school district policy or priorities he says As a result boards often are dominated by superintendents or spe cial interest groups The boards says Cibulka are not setting the reform agenda In smaller communities however school boards still retain their tradi tional roots In most such communities residents consider their school boards important according to Christy Coleman president of the Illinois School Boards Association and a mem ber of the rural Geneseo Ill school board She notes that the vast majority of school board members are unpaid and therefore really have no agenda other than to make local schools better which in turn makes their local com munities more attractive and valuable Coleman concedes however that not all school board members are effective though most try to put a high priority on student achievement Nothing is more predictable than annual panels of school board and superintendent leaders at their respec tive national conferences exchanging compliments and pledges to get along They write policies and statements to guide local leadership which if fol lowed would seem to assure respectful relationships School boards need to be convinced to focus on achievement contends Deborah Land of Johns Hopkins University A survey by the National School Boards Association found that only percent of superin tendents believed it was very important to hold school boards accountable for raising student achievement but if they accepted this responsibility their effec tiveness would improve she predicted Highperforming urban districts almost always have strong boards in the opinion of Donald McAdams president of the Center for Reform of School Systems and former Houston school board member He cites as examples CharlotteMecklenberg NC and Houston

Pasqual Pat Forgione with kids below superintentendent of Austin Independent school district shining armor and overcome local poli tics where these wretched school board members are just screwing things up As a former member of the much praised Houston school board he says the dynamic of district leadership is much more complicated The Houston school board for example adopted a detailed statement on beliefs and visions and decided on a brief plan for a new district structure directing the superintendent to initiate a process for the development of a plan to imple ment the beliefs For instance board members set as a priority improving overall achievement of students declared the dropout rate as unaccept ably high and stipulated that schools were overly regulated Another urban district that is managing to avoid superintendent turnover and major controversy is Boston according to Marla Ucelli of the Annenberg Institute The superintend ent Tom Payzant accepted the position only after an agreement from the mayor who controls the school system that he would be given at least five years to enact reforms The average tenure of all public school superintendents is about seven years Yet most prominent urban districts like New York City Dallas and Kansas City made at least three or four appointments between and Thomas Glass of the University of Memphis says chronic superintendent turnover or churn is indicative of a boards inability to func tion effectively and that the results of bringing a new superintendent on board every few years can be disastrous It not only confuses and discourages district staff but also conjures up a public image of a district in turmoil he says Often overlooked is how superin tendent turnover usually derails ongo ing reform

know their boards are going to support them they are more likely to take risks aimed at bringing about reform But superintendents unsure of what their board members want or insecure about how they will respond to controversy are reluctant to stick their necks out in an effort to bring about change One of the few attempts to study the link between school board performance and student achievement was undertak en by the Iowa Association of School Boards in The associations Lighthouse Study compared school boards and superintendents in unusual ly high and unusually lowachieving districts of similar size The study controlled for differences in the districts demographics The study found that board members in both the high and low achieving districts maintained good relationships with their superintendents and had positive opinions of them Board members in all the districts stud ied also exhibited a caring for children However in the highachieving dis tricts board members and superintend ents consistently said their job was to release each students potential They also were constantly seeking ways to improve the district and viewed social or economic problems as challenges In the lowachieving districts board mem bers and superintendents were more likely to simply accept shortcomings in the students or in the district Their emphasis was on managing the district rather than changing or improving it Board members in the successful dis tricts also knew more about school reform initiatives and the boards role in supporting them than their peers in the lowachieving districts And in the high achieving districts board members knowledge and beliefs were translated into initiatives at the classroom level This study is reinforced by other research Richard H Goodman project director at the New England School Development Council examined school districts in five states He found that wellrun districts had lower dropout rates a higher percentage of students going on to college and higher aptitude test scores than poorly run districts For the purposes of the study quality governance included a focus by the board on student achievement a positive relationship between the board and superintendent and the ability of the superintendent to function as the CEO and instructional leader Poor governance was characterized by micromanagement by board members conflict and poor communication between board members and the super intendent and confusion over their respective roles See sidebar on p The most recent study by MDRC released in and commissioned by the Council of the Great City Schools shows similar results Once again a shared vision was key for the more suc cessful urban districts among the case studies Student achievement was the highest priority as well as focusing on achievable goals and the lowest per forming schools The districts reformed to serve and support schools In com parison the typical districts lacked consensus among their leaders lacked concrete goals and took little responsi bility for improving instruction Glass provides clues as to other behaviors that indicate an ineffective school board members who ran on a platform reflecting narrow interests or special interest groups boards that are out of touch with the electorate and boards that lack experienced leaders from other sectors in the community such as business and civic

tendency itself with boards opting to hire leaders with corporate or military experience rather than educational expertise It is a trend gaining momen tum with Seattle Chicago Los Angeles and New York City as prime examples In still other cases the tradi tional superintendents role has been divided up and its duties split between a chief executive officer generally a noneducator and chief educational officer In San Diego for example Anthony Alvarado has served as chan cellor for instruction with Alan Bersin a former federal prosecutor as chief education officer although he planned to resign in September and scaled back his work with the district to part time recently A big innovation to watch is mayoral control of school districts Beginning in the mids states have turned over at least partial control of urban school districts to mayors in Chicago Philadelphia New York City Cleveland Detroit Oakland and Boston Mayoral takeovers can be good for students and in the mayors own best interests according to Thomas Glass of the University of Memphis Large cities struggling hard to retain businesses renew Although core areas and attract new investments hardly need a highly publicized failing school district There is no evidence mayoral takeovers have yet increased student achievement he believes school boards appointed by mayors are more stable than elected boards and

with boards that cannot establish a clear directive for improvement says Kirst What they need is a quick large jolt and mayors have been able to deliver that in some cases Kirst says mayors who take over schools need to have a lot of confidence in their leadership ability You have to be a pretty bold person to say Im willing to be held accountable for this system with all of its problems thats hard to turn around Schools in Chicago Boston and Cleveland where residents recently voted to continue mayoral control have improved according to Kirst Theyre not really high quality but are on the right track he says The reason may oral control has failed in cities such as Detroit and Oakland is that the mayors there were not given or were not willing to accept full control he says A study comparing mayoral controlled school districts completed in found different results but in all three no perceptible change in stu dent achievement Similarly Baltimore changed its governance from mayoral control to a partnership between the state and the district and only after more than four years and three superintendents plus one interim were there signs of improved student achievement Check the EFFECTIVENESS of the COMMUNITY J ust as schools depend on district student achievement is the top priority but so must community leaders The general public should be providing feedback as well it concludes leadership districts depend on the strengths of their communities If I were thinking about reforming a school district the first place Id look is to the community Glass says noting that very few effective schools are found in what he calls disorganized commu nities places where citizens fail to agree on major social and educational issues Id ask Does the community know where the district is in terms of achievement and program effectiveness What are the communitys educational priorities What does the community want the school district to do Is there support for those things Are people willing to pay for them To participate in the process The MDRC study notes that success ful urban districts engage the commu nity Not only must the school board and superintendent agree that improved In his book Leadership Without Easy Answers Heifetz says that leaders must challenge their communities to face problems for which there are no simple painless solutions And successful reform efforts require longterm com mitted support from outside the school system says Hill in his book It Takes A City Getting Serious about Urban School Reform Superintendents are good sources of daytoday leadership but given their short tenures their efforts are not enough according to Hill Leadership must come from a longer lasting source and one that is both more deeply rooted in the community than a superintendent and less protective of the status quo than a school board or central office E F F E C T I V E S U P E R I N T E N D E N T S E F F E C T I V E B O A R D S Conclusion LEADING for LEARNING T he ability of a superintendent or a school board to engage in community building and shared decisionmaking or for that matter to adroitly navigate a school districts oftenturbulent political waters is meaningless unless such efforts improve student achievement The goal must be to become true instructional leaders focused on provid ing a school environment in which quality teaching and learning can flour ish How to get there Demand that school board members and school superintendents measure their own effectiveness by one and only one meas ure according to how well their stu dents achieve Focusing on school leadership with out addressing other issues ie the social conditions that put children at risk of doing poorly in school teacher quality or inadequate school financing is indeed shortsighted Yet the emerg ing research suggests that improving student achievement across a district will only occur under leaders who are collaborative rather than confrontation al and know how to use politics to bring about change Those leaders need a vision and plans to achieve that vision Their decisions must be based on hard data rather than conjecture And they must have the political will and person al commitment to stay the course rather than succumb to the lure of a quick fix Although no one is minimizing the impact that gifted teachers have on stu dent performance the Institute for Educational Leadership says teachers alone cant make better learning a reali ty for all students in a school system Real learning seldom takes place with out sensitive yet forceful guidance from those who fill educations leadership positions leaders who focus on the importance of developing highper forming organizations enlightened public attitudes and a

Newsfeed With Churn at the Nations Largest School Districts Experts Agree A Good Superintendent Is Hard to Find By BETH HAWKINS January TALKING POINTS Photo credit Getty Images The recent announcement that Michelle King will retire as superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District by the end of the school year brought several months of uncertainty to a very sad end A year veteran of the district King disclosed she was leaving the job to focus on treatment in the wake of a cancer diagnosis Lonely at the Top Leadership churn in the nations largest school districts underscores the difficulty of finding and keeping innovative superintendents Claypool Faria King Superintendents in the largest school districts departing at virtually the same time highlights the shortage of top talent Do urban schools chiefs live or die by Coming after a leave of absence that went unexplained for four months Kings revelation ended one swirl of speculation but triggered another With seasoned urban superintendents in extremely short supply and LAUSD facing an avalanche of financial and political issues who might be tapped to lead the nations secondlargest school district Adding urgency to the question in recent weeks the superintendencies in New York City and Chicago the largest and third largest US school districts respectively have also been vacated Superintendents have long been in short supply and veterans of large urban districts even more so Even so to have asterisks at the top spot of the three largest US districts at the same time is unusual All superintendents are called on to manage daunting challenges ranging from increasing academic achievement to managing elected board members and union leaders and other wouldbe adversaries to operating a large transportation system But the issues top leaders of the very largest school districts must confront often seem virtually insurmountable academic achievement Not so much say experts Its the political frame that tends to undo superintendents SIGN UP FOR THE T NEWSLETTER Enter Email Address SUBMIT TRENDING NOW EduClips FLs In God We Trust Debate Trump DACA and More News from Americas Top Districts Texas PostHarvey Houston Faces Perfect Storm Its a lonely job and a very unique one says Mike Magee CEO of Chiefs for Change which provides training mentorship and advocacy for wouldbe state and district education heads Superintendents who exhibit bold and savvy leadership for more than a decade are outliers Three asterisks The recent highprofile turnovers throw into relief the difficulty of identifying individuals capable of the array of skills the job requires and of creating conditions where they can make the change they were hired to engineer In late December after four years on the job and a flurry of dismal headlines about Mayor Bill de Blasios signature Renewal Schools New York Schools Chancellor Carmen Faria announced she will soon leave Earlier in the month Chicago Public Schools CEO Forrest Claypool stepped down amid accusations of ethics violations He was quickly replaced by Chief Academic Officer Janice Jackson a CPS grad of Budget Damage California CA School Administrators Endorse Tuck for Superintendent Innovation How to Educate Students for the Automation Economy Supreme Court Union Members Remain in the Dark About Pivotal Dues Case Texas Special Ed Shell Game in Texas Whos to Blame Union Report Union Numbers Rise Modestly Despite Decline Among Local Government Workers RELATED New Chicago Schools CEO Will Have to Repair Districts Reputation Fight Decreasing Enrollment All three districts are experiencing steep declines in enrollment which translates to a revenue loss that compounds the financial blow of skyrocketing employee health and pension expenditures With a collective enrollment of more than million students each serves mindblowing concentrations of students in poverty those with disabilities and children who are learning English All compete with charter and private schools The kicker The more decisively a superintendent takes on the thorniest of these challenges the more likely he or she is to see the support of the board members themselves under pressure from fractious constituencies erode Average tenure is a little more than three years Its the political frame that tends to undo superintendents and not the academic work says Steven Tozer a professor in education policy studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the Center for Urban Education Leadership Of debt and DACA A popular hire who rose through the district ranks King was LAUSDs ninth superintendent in years Fierce disagreement over the role of charter schools dominated board politics during her twoyear tenure including a board election in which spending topped million More daunting King was tasked with attempting to close a budget deficit of billion projected to accumulate between the and school years Healthcare and pension expenditures currently consume percent of state per pupil funds With in Los Angeles County residents lacking legal residency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE officers increasingly emboldened to monitor schools and other sites once considered offlimits King was also on the front lines of an ongoing crisis touched off by the Trump Administrations threats to end DACA and other immigration supports The LA board was scheduled to begin discussing search for a new superintendent this week Longtime administrator Vivian Ekchian who took over daytoday operations when King went on leave will remain acting superintendent for now RELATED Los Angeles Schools Chief Michelle King Currently on Medical Leave Says She Will Retire by End of June The fiscal cliff Chicagos schools are controlled by Mayor Rahm Emanuel whose Board of Education is expected to confirm Janice Jacksons interim appointment later this month Like King Jackson is an educator who rose through district ranks a trajectory that has already prompted one city council member to describe her as the antiForrest a reference to her predecessor Emanuels former chief of staff Forrest Claypool cleaned up one scandal the corruption investigation that landed his predecessor Barbara ByrdBennett in federal prison only to find himself mired in another Not an educator Claypool resigned after accusations that he lied to investigators looking into a questionable contract Though the size of Chicago Public Schools financial cliff is hotly debated Jackson told the Chicago Tribune she wants to decrease the amount the district borrows annually to less than billion The Chicago Board of Education had billion of outstanding debt last year according to a CPS report City and state leaders have battled over CPSs demands for more state funding for years Illinois lawmakers last year overhauled state funding sending hundreds of millions more dollars to the district Jackson will still have to contend with servicing existing debt and with the redhot issue of closing underenrolled schools that languished during a moratorium on closures New York City Schools Chancellor Carmen Faria has been closely identified with Mayor Bill de Blasios signature initiatives most notably Renewal Schools An effort to turn around lowperforming schools the halfbilliondollar effort has shown lackluster results The city now plans to close or merge several of the schools No candidate has emerged to replace Faria and indeed its tough to imagine the skill set a person would need to deliver results for more than million students Navigating a sea of political interests Some years ago the Center on Reinventing Public Education CRPE put out a survey of superintendents titled The Impossible Job recalls Robin Lake the centers executive director The way things are set up from a political board to community interest groups to union politics to state political dynamics they really are navigating a sea of political interests she says while at the same time not really in control of their schools and able to serve their needy student populations By way of illustration Lake recounts a conversation she had with a district superintendent who had previously run a charter school management organization When I was running a district I had a board that was focused on its political interests the leader told her At the charter management organization its a missiondriven board so its cohesive were not stuck seesawing back and forth In districts where schools chiefs report to mayors or to state overseers the politics are just different Few superintendents start their jobs prepared to navigate them But building some political capacity can have real payoffs RELATED Not the Same as the Old Boss After Carmen Faria What Mayor De Blasio Will and Wont Be Looking for in NYCs Next Schools Chief Lakes CRPE colleagues Paul Hill and Ashley Jochim have released a report on ways in which superintendents can use political skill to get results Hill cites several examples of superintendents who were able to negotiate wins on tough issues Getting results Farias New York predecessor Joel Klein for example got the teachers union to break with the ironclad hirebyseniority contracts of the past and agree to allow principals and other school leaders to choose their staffs by allying with teachers who wanted to choose their colleagues In Denver former superintendent Michael Bennet who is now a US senator convinced the union to go along with performancebased teacher pay as part of a plan to raise district enrollment Clevelands Eric Gordon met frequently with principals to build their support encourage initiative and risktaking and learn about ways the central office was getting in the way of promised school autonomies In New Orleans then Recovery School District Superintendent Patrick Dobard pushed charter schools to give up some autonomy and to collaborate on special education It helps Lake adds to have one or more outside organizations shepherding the change Who holds the longterm vision for the schoolimprovement strategy The superintendent cant because they may be gone in four or five years The board likely wont Denver is a good example of a district where clarity among community leaders about the direction they want for the schools has helped to keep the work moving forward despite churn in the superintendents office Current superintendent Tom Boasberg has been able to continue strategies launched under Bennet Chicago Public Schools has seen notable academic improvements despite having eight superintendents since Paul Vallas stepped down in says Tozer in part because the district has placed a premium on building its principal corps ensuring there are enough talented candidates for local school councils to find leaders who are a good fit Every school district is a study between centralized control and local control he says Because the systems in Chicago are focused on highquality building leadership as [district] leaders come and go they dont mess with that Hurdles notwithstanding school districts still gravitate to searching for a new superintendent who can do it all imagining a search firm or other intermediary might know of a potential leader whose unique combination of skills personality and vision will thread the needle A really stressful job Two years ago a number of state and district leaders launched Chiefs for Change an effort to prime a diverse pipeline of individuals poised to take top jobs and be effective leaders The group also serves as a community of practice in which leaders can draw on one anothers experiences Especially for new superintendents coaching and mentorship constitute one of three key ways to help district leaders navigate the job says Magee Its a really stressful job and you need people whove gone before you to be successful he says Its such a big deal if you have a set of peers you know you can talk to about your challenges Its the biggest factor and its the one most people lack The other two major components of success are a talented team and access to philanthropic support he says Struggling districts often lack top talent and no superintendent can create change alone Nor are state legislators and local taxpayers frequently willing to bankroll new superintendents ideas and success breeds buyin Right now Magees network has members Chiefs for Change got more than applications for its next yearly cohort of eight The demand is high and the caliber is top flight says Magee In the end Magee Lake and others agree the job isnt going to become less political and perhaps it shouldnt My members spent a lot of time doing community engagement and doing a lot of board work says Magee They eat a lot of spaghetti dinners trying to create the relationships that allow you to go forward with the work Its challenging Everyone deals with political firestorms of one kind or another he says But its the
