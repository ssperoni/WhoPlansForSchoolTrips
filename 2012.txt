year of education budget cuts by the State As a result the District is facing two main issues The first issue is cash the amount of the funds due to the District from the state where the payment has been deferred have made it difficult for the District to fulfill current obligations The second issue is the actual budget cuts that the state is imposing in the per pupil revenues and to other funds The District is currently trying to figure out how to deal with revenues instead of reductions Superintendent Deasy stated that he will be making recommendations on consolidations in terms of how the District services largescale offices with the ultimate goal of sending every dollar possible to the schools Currently the District is facing a deficit of million The Governor has proposed a budget for consideration and there are three main issues to discuss First is how the proposed budget is contingent on the public approving a ballot initiative The second is the formulaic constraints that happen if the initiative is approved Lastly what happens if the tax initiative is not approved There are indications that if approved the funds will only be used to cover deferred funds and will not increase per pupil revenues necessary for the District to fulfill its educational mission The District is also considering the possibility of a local revenue initiative such as a parcel tax to restore services support and people in the amount of approximately million In terms of the state and local revenue initiatives there are two main concerns First no decisions will be made until well into the school year Secondly the District will have to make decisions on how to operate the system where technically employees and programs are not funded Without these initiatives many programs and services will end the second semester of the school year Remarks were heard from Board Members President Garca modified the Order of Business PUBLIC COMMENT The following speakers addressed the Board on the subject

be it finally Resolved That the Office of Integration report back to the Board within days about the risks and benefits of creating a three choice magnet application process for the school year BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Ms Garca Ms Martinez Resolution to Examine Increasing Choice and Removing Boundaries for Neighborhood Schools Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District is responsible for ensuring that children educated in the District have the opportunity to receive a quality education to earn a meaningful college preparatory high school diploma and to graduate collegeprepared and careerready Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas Every child is unique with special talents strengths and needs and school placement decisions must therefore be made in the best educational needs of each individual student addressing such factors as proximity to home areas of academic interest and interest in specific educational supports Whereas Research validates that parental involvement in public schools is a key factor in producing measurable gains in student academic success closing the achievement gap reducing dropout rates increasing graduation rates promoting positive adolescent behavior and furthering students emotional development Whereas A parentguardian has the right to demand what hisher child needs to succeed in school and should have the right to consider school atmosphere class size test scores before and afterschool programs specific academic focus and proximity to the home when deciding where a student will obtain hisher education Whereas Indistrict models for open enrollment policies illustrate the ways in which they support accelerated academic achievement These include the Belmont Zone of Choice which offers different pilot schools and Small Learning Communities from which incoming th graders and their families may choose and the Kennedy Zone of Choice which offers six small schools from which students and their families may choose and Whereas The current Open Enrollment Transfer process provides opportunities for families to choose District schools outside of their attendance boundaries but is unnecessarily limited in the number of students that may participate now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District instructs the Superintendent to develop a plan that would consider removing boundaries for schools in order to give parents the flexibility for their children to take advantage of all seats in highperforming schools and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will return to the Board within days with alternatives and recommendations for a new Open Enrollment Policy that will serve all students Districtwide and will allow all students and their families to select the school that best meets students educational needs This resolution will be for action at the Special Board Meeting of January Ms Garca Ms Martinez Mr Zimmer Resolution to Support the Motion to Amend the Daytime Curfew Law Whereas The Los Angeles City Council Motion Motion by Councilmember Tony Cardenas seeks to amend the daytime curfew law so that it is consistent with recent policy directives by the Los Angeles School Police Department LASPD and the Los Angeles Police Department LAPD regarding proper enforcement Whereas The LASPD policy directive and the commitments clarifying the scope and application of the daytime curfew reinforce the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Superintendents commitment to reducing the cycle of student push out Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The Motions amendments seek to narrow the scope of the curfew law and protect students rights by placing explicit restrictions on the ability to ticket students who are traveling to school eliminating the imposition of fines as a penalty requiring LAPD data collection and reporting and restoring a freedom of speech exception Whereas The District is committed to improving regular student attendance and recognizes the multitude of evidencebased explanations for student tardiness andor truancy which according to reports issued by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention can include issues related to school climate andor the ability to meet the diverse needs of students emotional and social factors of the student and their family economic circumstances such as the lack of reliable andor affordable transportation and student variables such as mental health substance abuse special education and physical health issues Whereas The District has in place a comprehensive set of attendance policies and procedures consistent with federal state and District requirements that is designed to assist school personnel with understanding and addressing student attendance issues like truancy and tardiness Whereas A welcoming school climate implemented attendance procedures and attendance incentive programs supported by the Districts Discipline Foundation Policy of SchoolWide Positive Behavior Support adopted by the Board in and which applies to every school in the District promotes improved student attendance Whereas According to the LAPD and LASPD data more than tickets were issued to students from under the daytime curfew law Whereas Law enforcement officers issuing tickets to students who are on their way to or arriving at school has the unintended consequence of deterring or preventing some students from going to school Whereas Daytime curfew tickets issued to District students result in students missing one or more days of school to attend court hearings such that students lose additional valuable instructional time and the District loses substantial Average Daily Attendance ADA state revenue over the course of a school year Whereas The Youth WorkSource Centers have been highly successful in providing services to youth and have become a nationally recognized leader in implementing youth programs in the seven Los Angeles City planning areas The Centers are prepared to be an alternative for students who are outofschool rather than the traditional criminal justice system approach now therefore be it Resolved That the District shall work together with the Los Angeles City Council Los Angeles Police Department the Community Development Department the Countywide Truancy Task Force and the Los Angeles School Police Department to develop an evidencebased alternative to increase student attendance and intervene appropriately when students are truant The Los Angeles Unified School District and CDD are in the process of soliciting qualified entities to manage Youth WorkSource Centers that will serve as an alternative to daytime curfew citations in Los Angeles Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved further That the District shall work together with parent groups community organizations and public interest law firms to explore effective methods of addressing the issue of truancy and promoting student attendance through the existing SchoolWide Positive Behavior Support policy and other evidencebased school interventions Resolved further That the Superintendent or his designee will continue to ensure that data related to daytime curfew tickets is routinely collected and disaggregated and that training of LASPD officers aligns with and supports the evidencebased practice of developing relationships between students and officers that promote attendance and be it finally Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports City Councilmember Tony Crdenas Motion Supported by Councilmember Bernard Parks to Amend the Daytime Curfew Law in efforts to best serve our youth This resolution will be for action at the Special Board Meeting of January The Board is in receipt of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report RECEIPT OF SPECIAL REPORT ANNOUNCEMENTS The motion to schedule a Regular Board
