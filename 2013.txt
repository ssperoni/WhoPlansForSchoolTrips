RESOLUTIONS FOR ACTION Ms Garca Ms LaMotte Celebration of Black History Month Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas The first event was celebrated during a week in February encompassing the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas two key figures in the history of African Americans Whereas When this week was officially established in the Library of Congress National Archives and Records Administration National Endowment for the Humanities National Gallery of Art National Park Service Smithsonian Institution and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum joined in to pay official tribute to the generations of African Americans who struggled with adversity to achieve full citizenship in American society Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District stated that the academic performance of African American students which is among the four lowest academic performing groups gave demands for an urgent action by the Los Angeles Unified School District Whereas The District recognizes the importance of culturally relevant and historically accurate education in improving academic performance and has implemented the Academic English Mastery Program AEMP in several of its schools and Whereas Black History Month is an opportunity for all students and stakeholders to enrich their educational experience and to deepen their understanding of the role of African Americans in the development of the United States and the world now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as Black History Month and be it finally Resolved That the Superintendent will work with all schools of the District to recognize and celebrate Black History Month through culturally relevant activities and through indepth discussions of historically relevant topics Ms Martinez Ms Galatzan Ms Garca Resolution to Ensure Children Are Protected in School Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District is fully committed to closing the achievement gap ensuring that all students receive a meaningful robust and rigorous education and that all students have access to resources they need to graduate high school collegeprepared and career ready Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The District is committed to ensuring a safe learning environment and must take all measures to protect children in and out of the classroom Whereas On June the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District adopted core values to further communicate the Districts priorities to students parents teachers and other employees of the District Whereas The Core Values to Keep Our Students Safe were adopted as follows The most important responsibility of all District employees is the safety of our students No person who presents a recognized threat to the physical or emotional health of students will knowingly be allowed to come into contact with children in our care and In balancing the safety of our students against the rights of adults children always come first Whereas While this Board recognizes that the overwhelming majority of teachers and other District employees are competent and caring professionals committed to the safety and academic success of all students no accommodation or protection can be extended to any employee who preys on children Whereas Recent events make it clear that heightened vigilance and more proactive measures are needed for the District to more effectively identify prosecute and terminate any employee who endangers the physical or emotional health of our students Whereas When school districts decide to dismiss a teacher for unprofessional immoral or criminal conduct state policies make the dismissal process ineffective and costly Whereas School boards are subject to extensive notification periods before a notice of dismissal may be issued and must defer to a hearing panel for the final decision of a teachers dismissal when the dismissal is appealed and prevents a school board from acting decisively to dismiss a teacher in misconduct cases Whereas Dismissing a teacher can take between two and seven years depending on the number of appeals and costs an average of Whereas In practice sections of the existing Education Code do not provide for vigorous and fair investigations of all allegations of misconduct and does not even empower local school boards to make final decisions on dismissals Whereas The provisions of Education Code Section c ties the Districts hands in situations where swift and decisive action is needed to reassure parents and guardians because a trusted employee has engaged in unspeakable behavior involving a child Whereas In and the Board approved resolutions calling on the California Legislature to make numerous changes to the permanent employee dismissal process when the conduct in question involves a serious violation of student safety or wellbeing Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Whereas The California Legislature has failed to approve necessary legislation that is critical in empowering local school districts to promptly respond to cases of egregious misconduct against children and Whereas Senate Bill Padilla would expedite the dismissal process for certificated public school employees in cases involving sex drugs or violence involving children now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District strongly supports the passage and enactment into law of SB that has been introduced in the California State Senate by Senator Alex Padilla RESOLUTIONS REQUESTED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT Appointment of Member to the School Construction Bond Oversight Committee Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District ratifies the nomination of Mr Ron Miller representing the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor AFL CIO as member to the
