Association for the Study of African American Life and History ASALH an organization now in its Centennial Year Whereas The theme for Black History Month established by the ASALH is Hallowed Grounds The Sites of African American Memories Whereas The story of America cannot be told without reflecting on places where African Americans made history in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as The Kingsley Plantation DuSables home site the numerous stops along the Underground Railroad Seneca Village Mother Bethel AME Church and Frederick Douglass home Whereas The story of the struggle for equal citizenship for African Americans can be documented by the significance of landmarks such as Mary McLeod Bethunes home in Washington DC th Street in Harlem Beale Street in Memphis and Sweet Auburn Avenue in Atlanta Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and

prepared and career ready Whereas The middle grade years are a time of heightened vulnerability as the years between th and th grade are known for an increase in disciplinary problems motivational decline and initiation in risky behaviors Whereas Chronic absenteeism and behavioral problems in middle grades are clear warnings signals of leaving high school and without early intervention struggling middle school students will continue to leave school Whereas Los Angeles County has some of the largest middle schools in the nation with some grade sizes at least seven times larger in middle school than in elementary school These large environments can be intimidating for both students and parents and can impede learning Whereas In response to The Forgotten Middle report that described how critical it is for students to be on target for college and career the US Department of Education now recommends that students begin planning for college as early as th grade Whereas Middle grades education is the first step in the secondary to postsecondary pipeline and the last chance to get students on track for a high school curriculum that will make them college and career ready Whereas Students not adequately prepared in the middle grades for core high school subjects such as mathematics and English Language Arts can have difficulty catching up on college readiness

recently released Plan for Great Public Schools from the Eli Broad Foundation seeks to aggressively move over students from LAUSD public schools to privately operated underregulated charter schools

Americans who played a prominent role in shaping black history namely Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass whose birthdays are February th and th respectively Whereas Carter G Woodson believed that

following link httpwwwlaschoolboardorgcharterpetitions TAB Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report File Rep Version Denial of the Charter Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School [Public Hearing] Action Proposed Staff recommends denial of the charter petition for LAs Promise Charter High School LAPCHS proposed to be located in Board District and Local District West and adoption of the attached Findings of Fact In Support of Denial of the Charter Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School Background On October LAs Promise submitted a charter school petition application to the Charter Schools Division seeking approval to open and operate an independent charter high school to serve students in grade in year and up to students in grades by year five The school proposes to be located in Board District and Local District West Although the petition does not provide a specific facility address the school proposes to locate in the South VermontWest Slauson northern portion of the ZIP Code in South Los Angeles LAs Promise has indicated that it has applied for Proposition facilities under California Education Code section Upon submission the District comprehensively reviews each petition application to determine whether petitioners have met the requirements set forth in Education Code section The day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December Statutory Framework Education Code section b sets forth grounds for denying a charter petition Section b states that [t]he governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a [of section ] The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d [of section ] The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the [sixteen elements set Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version forth in section b] Grounds for Denial Staff of the Charter Schools Division and the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the charter school petition application for LAs Promise Charter High School and have assessed that the petition application does not meet the criteria for approval As fully discussed in the attached Findings of Fact In Support of Denial of the Charter Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School based on review of the petition supporting documentation and the LAs Promise record of performance staff has determined that petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the petition the petition proposes an unsound educational program and the petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the sixteen elements required in a charter school petition Petitioner LAs Promise currently operates three LAUSD Network Partner schools Manual Arts High School John Muir Middle School and West Adams Preparatory Although these schools have experienced overall academic growth since becoming partnership schools and have shown some recent improvement in the academic achievement of their significant subgroups the organizations petition application and record of performance clearly indicate that LAs Promise needs to stay focused on its current schools in order to sustain and build on recent gains and to institute the systemic corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet the needs of all students in accordance with applicable legal requirements and Board policy Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the proposed educational program Review of the performance record of the three LAs Promises schools reveals that the schools have not consistently met the needs of all students For example the organizations school Manual Arts High School has persistently underserved its substantial English Learner population as evidenced by an inconsistent record of achievement and the Superintendents recent notice to the school dated October requiring extensive and immediate corrective action to ensure appropriate placement supports and services for English Learners The schools academic performance data for this significant subgroup confirms that this group of students has not been served well thus far by LAs Promise schools eg for the past three years all three schools have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners Similarly LAs Promise needs to improve its school climate and student discipline outcomes for African American students and students with disabilities Suspension data for both Manual Arts High School and Muir Middle School shows markedly disproportionate rates of suspension for students in these two groups For example at Muir Middle School the suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide The petition submitted by LAs Promise reflects this demonstrated lack of capacity to meet the needs of all students especially English Learners For example the petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then this student does not need further evaluation of the English language proficiency Petition page This language contravenes the requirement that if the answers to any of the first three questions on the HLS indicate Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version a language other than English or a combination of English and another language the student is assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency See eg Ed Code California English Language Development Test CalEdFacts CDE The petition likewise fails to provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of a sound educational program that will meet the unique needs of English Learners The petition does not include specific descriptions of a welldeveloped English language acquisition program or the services and supports to be provided to English Learners including instructional strategies and interventions for Long Term English Learners LTELs Please see the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Charter School Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School A due diligence review of the proposed school leader and onsite financial manager is being performed by the Office of the Inspector General OIG Current LAs Promise Charter High School Governing Board members completed questionnaires regarding conflicts of interest The Board of Education held a public hearing on the petition for LAs Promise Charter High School on November The petition is available for perusal in the offices of the Charter Schools Division and online at the Districts Board of Education website at httplaschoolboardorgcharterpetitions Expected Outcomes Denial will prevent the establishment of LAs Promise Charter High School as an LAUSD authorized charter school at this time Board Options and Consequences If the Board adopts the recommendation of denial and the attached Findings of Fact in Support of Denial of the Charter School Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School LAs Promise Charter High School would not be authorized to open or operate as a charter school Petitioners may appeal the denial to the Los Angeles County Board of Education and the California State Board of Education for authorization by those entities If the Board does not adopt the recommendation of denial of the charter petition and the attached Findings of Fact In Support of Denial of the Renewal Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School and instead takes specific action to approve the charter petition LAs Promise Charter High School would be authorized to operate as a charter school for a charter term beginning July Within days the Board requires that to the Charter Schools Division a revised charter petition that meets all LAUSD the school submit requirements including but not limited to a reasonably comprehensive description of all sixteen required elements and compliance with current District Required Language Policy Implications No policy implications at this time Budget Impact The Local Control Funding Formula LCFF and various other income sources of the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school and corresponding reduction in expenditures may not occur in such cases If the Board adopts staff recommendation of denial of the petition the action will not have a budget impact If the Board does not adopt the staff denial recommendation and the petition is approved the Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version impact on the budget will be commensurate with the terms of the specific Special Education Local Plan Area SELPA MOU Option or executed by the charter school and the District Issues and Analysis Issues are outlined

Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School By the Los Angeles Unified School District BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT December The charter review process requires the authorizer to evaluate whether the charter petition meets the criteria for approval Education Code Section b states the required petition elements and conditions for denial Education Code Section outlines additional petition criteria I INTRODUCTION On October the Los Angeles Unified School District District received a charter petition Petition from LAs Promise a California nonprofit public benefit corporation requesting that the Districts Board of Education grant the LAs Promise Charter High School Charter School or Petitioner charter for a term of five years The Charter School seeks authorization to serve students in grade in year with expansion to students in year The Charter School proposes to operate in Board District Local District West Although the petition does not provide a specific facility address the school proposes to locate in the South VermontWest Slauson northern portion of the ZIP Code in South Los Angeles California Education Code section b provides that a school district governing board shall grant a charter for the operation of a school if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice Section b provides that the governing board shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain required elements as set forth in Education Code section subdivision bAP II STAFF SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION After a careful and thorough review of the Petition and all supporting documentation provided by Petitioner and data from the schools that operate pursuant to the LAs Promise Lead Partnership MOU District staff recommends that the Board of Education adopt these Findings of Fact for the denial of the LAs Promise Charter High School based on the following grounds cid The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school cid The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition cid The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain required elements as set forth in Education Code section subdivision bAP The State Board of Education SBE regulations defines unsound educational program in part to be a program that the [SBE] determines not to be likely to be of educational benefit to the pupils who attend CCR c Moreover in reviewing charter petitions the SBE considers the following set of factors in determining whether petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program cid The petitioners have a past history of involvement in charter schools or other education agencies public or private which the charter authorizing agency regards as unsuccessful eg the petitioners have been associated with a charter school of which the charter has been revoked or a private school that has ceased operation for reasons within the petitioners control cid The petitioners are unfamiliar with the content of the petition or the requirements of law that would apply to the proposed charter school cid The petitioners have presented an unrealistic financial and operational plan for the proposed charter school cid The petitioners personally lack the necessary background critical to the charter schools success and the petitioners do not have a plan to secure the services of individuals who have the necessary background in curriculum instruction assessment and finance and business management CCR c State Board of Education Regulations CCR Title Section Criteria for the Review and Approval of Charter School Petitions by the State Board of Education have been adopted in LAUSDs Charter Authorizing Petitioner LAs Promise is a nonprofit education organization that has an agreement with the District to facilitate reform efforts and manage the daily operations of three school sites through a Lead Partnership Memorandum of Understanding MOU LAs Promise currently operates three LAUSD Lead Partnership schools Manual Arts High School John Muir Middle School and West Adams Preparatory High School Although these schools have experienced overall academic growth since becoming partnership schools and have shown some recent improvement in the academic achievement of their significant subgroups the organizations petition application and record of performance indicate that LAs Promise needs to stay focused on improving its current schools in order to sustain and build on recent gains and to institute the systemic corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet the needs of all students Unsound Educational Program and Demonstrably Unlikely to Successfully Implement the Program Based on a review of data from the schools that LAs Promise operates the Charter Schools Division makes the following findings that petitioners present an unsound educational program and are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program cid One of the organizations schools Manual Arts High School has underserved its substantial English Learner population English Learner population as evidenced by an inconsistent record of achievement and the Superintendents recent notice of corrective actions to the school The corrective action notice addressed concerns that English Learners were not placed in the appropriate English Language Development course LAs Promise was required to remedy and complete extensive and immediate corrective actions to ensure appropriate placement supports and services for English Learners consistent with state and federal law Exhibit Letter from Superintendent Cortines to Manual Arts Principal October cid The academic performance data for the English Learner subgroup for all of the three LA Promise schools confirms that this significant subgroup of students have not shown academic improvement eg for the past three years all three schools have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners See Exhibit Title III Accountability Reports cid LAs Promise needs to improve its school climate and student discipline outcomes for African American students and students with disabilities Suspension data for both Manual Arts High School and Muir Middle School shows markedly disproportionate rates of suspension for students in these two groups At Muir Middle School the suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students Policies and Procedures as factors for determining whether petitioner presents an unsound educational program and that the petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program See httpachievelausdnetcmslibCACentricityDomainAdministrativeProcedures CharterSchoolsRevisedpdf are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide Exhibits a b Out of School Suspension Events Manual Arts HS and Muir MS In addition the petitioner presents an unsound educational program in that the petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then this student does not need further evaluation of the English language proficiency Petition page This language contravenes the requirement that if the answers to any of the first three questions on the HLS indicate a language other than English or a combination of English and another language the student is assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements Ed Code b Element Educational Program cid The petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then this student does not need further evaluation of the English language proficiency Petition

language the student is assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency cid The petition does not include specific descriptions of a welldeveloped English language acquisition program or the services and supports to be provided to English Learners including instructional strategies and interventions for Long Term English Learners LTELs Element Admission Requirements cid The lottery preferences in the petition providing higher priority for siblings and children of employees over students who reside in the District is inconsistent with the Education Code which requires that in the event of a public random drawing preference must be extended to pupils who reside in the school district Other preferences such as siblings and children of employees are discretionary preferences which are secondary in the order of lottery priorities Ed Code section dB Element Procedures by which Pupils Can be Suspended or Expelled cid The petition does not explicitly delineate mandatory versus discretionary grounds for suspension and expulsion which could lead to inconsistent implementation of disciplinary procedures cid The petition lists as discretionary grounds for suspension the disruption of school activities or otherwise willfully defied the valid authority of supervisors teachers administrators school officials or other school personnel engaged in the performance of their duties This is inconsistent with the LAUSDs Discipline Foundation Policy SchoolWide Positive Behavior Intervention and Support resulting from the Board Resolution School Discipline Policy and School Climate Bill of Rights made applicable to charter schools that are authorized by the District The policy requires alternatives to suspension and positive behavior intervention and supports and that no student will be suspended or expelled for willful defiance cid The suspension appeal process identifies the Principal as the administrator to hear and decide an appeal To assure due process rights of students the same person imposing the suspension should not be responsible for hearing appeals cid The expulsion appeal process identifies the same Board Discipline Committee to hear the underlying expulsion hearing and the appeal This description of the expulsion appeal process does not ensure due process if the same hearing board determines the results of the appeal t n e v E p s u S p o r p s i D e t a R d t S e g n S l i t n e v E p s u S e t a R d e l l o r n E d e l l o

Petition for LAs Promise Charter High School By the Los Angeles Unified School District BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT December Postponed to January I INTRODUCTION The Charter Schools Division CSD presents these supplemental findings of fact for the denial of the petition of LAs Promise High School On December the recommendation for the denial of the charter petition for LAs Promise High School and the adoption of the findings of fact in support of denial was agendized before the Board of Education On December the District and LAs Promise executed and signed a waiver of timelines and extension for the consideration of the petition to January On December the CSD met with the LAs Promise lead petitioner team to discuss and address the concerns raised by the District in the findings of fact The CSD also considered documentation provided by LAs Promise as well as additional information from the District Based on further review of the information and discussion with LAs Promise the CSD maintains its recommendation that the petition be denied The CSD remains concerned with some of the organizations systems in the areas shared to LAs Promise Leadership and which are the center for the denial recommendations II SUPPLEMENTAL FINDINGS OF FACT The CSD presents these supplemental findings of fact based on additional discussions with lead petitioner and review of District records These supplemental findings should be considered in conjunction with the Findings of Fact presented to the Board on December Petitioners are Demonstrably Unlikely to Successfully Implement the Educational Program In addition to the December Findings of Fact the Superintendent issued a board informative regarding collaborative strategies for Muir Middle School one of the schools operated by LAs Promise pursuant to the Network Partner MOU The board informative summarized a meeting held on December with LAs Promise several leaders from District divisions Local District West UTLA Superintendent Cortines Deputy Superintendent King and Chief of Staff for Board District The group discussed primary concerns over student discipline and need for collaboration between staff and administration Various strategies were discussed to address targeted interventions for students with frequent behavior issues See Board Informative December This meeting exemplifies the systemic issues and rationale raised in the Findings of Fact that the organizations record of performance indicate that LAs Promise needs to stay focused on improving its current schools in order to sustain and build on recent gains and to institute the systemic corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet cidcidcid the needs of all students The student discipline issue is of particular importance since suspension data at Muir Middle School shows that suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide See Exhibits a b from December Findings of Fact Out of School Suspension Events Manual Arts HS and Muir MS Furthermore On December an Interoffice Correspondence was sent to Ms Veronica Melvin by Ms Hilda Maldonado providing an update on the Manual Arts High School compliance matters with the implementation of a comprehensive and compliant English language development program for all English learners student placement schedules individual student plans and the spring master schedule See

DATE November FROM Ramon C Cortines Superintendent of Schools SUBJECT CHARTER PETITION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DENIAL OF LAS PROMISE PETITIONS AND APPROVAL OF ALLIANCE RENEWAL PETITIONS This board informative is to apprise the Board regarding Staff recommendations for two new petitions from LAs Promise and six renewal petitions from the Alliance College Ready Public Schools which are agendized for the December meeting LAs Promise Charter Petitions LAs Promise has submitted two petitions for the establishment of two new independent charter schoolsone middle school and one high schoolwith proposed locations in Board District As the Board knows LAs Promise is a lead partner pursuant to the Lead Partner Memorandum of Understanding MOU and manages the daily operations of three District schools according to the terms of the MOU Those schools are Manual Arts High School West Adams Preparatory High School and Muir Middle School The Charter Schools Division is recommending the denial of the two charter petitions The board report and the findings of fact in support of the denial outline the specific reasons for the denial I support Staff recommendation especially in light of a corrective action letter I sent in October addressing concerns that English Learner students from Manual Arts HS have not been placed in the appropriate English Language Development courses In addition the schools academic performance data shows that for the past three years all three schools under LAs Promise have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners LAs Promise provides support as a lead partner through its own fundraising and does not receive ADA revenues Presumably establishment of charter schools would provide them with greater autonomies and revenues to operate more schools However as stated in the findings to deny the school although the schools have experienced overall academic growth since becoming partnership schools and have shown some recent improvement in the academic achievement of their significant subgroups the organizations record of performance indicate

does not provide a specific facility address the school proposes to locate within the Western and Vernon intersection ZIP Code in South Los Angeles LAs Promise has indicated that it has applied for Proposition facilities under California Education Code section Upon submission the District comprehensively reviews each petition application to determine whether petitioners have met the requirements set forth in Education Code section The day statutory timeline for Board action on this petition runs through December Statutory Framework Education Code section b sets forth grounds for denying a charter petition Section b states that [t]he governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings

enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a [of section ] The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d [of section ] The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive

corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet the needs of all students in accordance with applicable legal requirements and Board policy Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the proposed educational program Review of the performance record of the three LAs Promises schools reveals that the schools have not consistently met the needs of all students For example the organizations school Manual Arts High School has persistently underserved its substantial English Learner population as evidenced by an inconsistent record of achievement and the Superintendents recent notice to the school dated October requiring extensive and immediate corrective action to ensure appropriate placement supports and services for English Learners The schools academic performance data for this significant subgroup confirms that this group of students has not been served well thus far by LAs Promise schools eg for the past three years all three schools have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners Similarly LAs Promise needs to improve its school climate and student discipline outcomes for African American students and students with disabilities Suspension data for both Manual Arts High School and Muir Middle School shows markedly disproportionate rates of suspension for students in these two groups For example at Muir Middle School the suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide The petition submitted by LAs Promise reflects this demonstrated lack of capacity to meet the needs of all students especially English Learners For example the petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then

assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency See eg Ed Code California English Language

Denial of the Charter Petition for LAs Promise Charter Middle School By the Los Angeles Unified School District BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT December The charter review process requires the authorizer to evaluate whether the charter petition meets the criteria for approval Education Code Section b states the required petition elements and conditions for denial Education Code Section outlines additional petition criteria I INTRODUCTION On October the Los Angeles Unified School District District received a charter petition Petition from LAs Promise a California nonprofit public benefit corporation requesting that the Districts Board of Education grant the LAs Promise Charter Middle School Charter School or Petitioner charter for a term of five years The Charter School seeks authorization to serve students in grade in year and up to students in grades by year five The school proposes to be located in Board District and Local District Central Although the petition does not provide a specific facility address the school proposes to locate within the Western and Vernon intersection ZIP Code in South Los Angeles California Education Code section b provides that a school district governing board shall grant a charter for the operation of a school if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice Section b provides that the governing board shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain required elements as set forth in Education Code section subdivision bAP II STAFF SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION After a careful and thorough review of the Petition and all supporting documentation provided by Petitioner and data from the schools that operate pursuant to the LAs Promise Lead Partnership MOU District staff recommends that the Board of Education adopt these Findings of Fact for the denial of the LAs Promise Charter Middle School based on the following grounds cid The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school cid The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition cid The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain required elements as set forth in Education Code section subdivision bAP The State Board of Education SBE regulations defines unsound educational program in part to be a program that the [SBE] determines not to be likely to be of educational benefit to the pupils who attend CCR c Moreover in reviewing charter petitions the SBE considers the following set of factors in determining whether petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program cid The petitioners have a past history of involvement in charter schools or other education agencies public or private which the charter authorizing agency regards as unsuccessful eg the petitioners have been associated with a charter school of which the charter has been revoked or a private school that has ceased operation for reasons within the petitioners control cid The petitioners are unfamiliar with the content of the petition or the requirements of law that would apply to the proposed charter school cid The petitioners have presented an unrealistic financial and operational plan for the proposed charter school cid The petitioners personally lack the necessary background critical to the charter schools success and the petitioners do not have a plan to secure the services of individuals who have the necessary background in curriculum instruction assessment and finance and business management CCR c State Board of Education Regulations CCR Title Section Criteria for the Review and Approval of Charter School Petitions by the State Board of Education have been adopted in LAUSDs Charter Authorizing Petitioner LAs Promise is a nonprofit education organization that has an agreement with the District to facilitate reform efforts and manage the daily operations of three school sites through a Lead Partnership Memorandum of Understanding MOU LAs Promise currently operates three LAUSD Lead Partnership schools Manual Arts High School John Muir Middle School and West Adams Preparatory High School Although these schools have experienced overall academic growth since becoming partnership schools and have shown some recent improvement in the academic achievement of their significant subgroups the organizations petition application and record of performance indicate that LAs Promise needs to stay focused on improving its current schools in order to sustain and build on recent gains and to institute the systemic corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet the needs of all students Unsound Educational Program and Demonstrably Unlikely to Successfully Implement the Program Based on a review of data from the schools that LAs Promise operates the Charter Schools Division makes the following findings that petitioners present an unsound educational program and are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program cid One of the organizations schools Manual Arts High School has underserved its substantial English Learner population English Learner population as evidenced by an inconsistent record of achievement and the Superintendents recent notice of corrective actions to the school The corrective action notice addressed concerns that English Learners were not placed in the appropriate English Language Development course LAs Promise was required to remedy and complete extensive and immediate corrective actions to ensure appropriate placement supports and services for English Learners consistent with state and federal law Exhibit Letter from Superintendent Cortines to Manual Arts Principal October cid The academic performance data for the English Learner subgroup for all of the three LA Promise schools confirms that this significant subgroup of students have not shown academic improvement eg for the past three years all three schools have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners See Exhibit Title III Accountability Reports cid LAs Promise needs to improve its school climate and student discipline outcomes for African American students and students with disabilities Suspension data for both Manual Arts High School and Muir Middle School shows markedly disproportionate rates of suspension for students in these two groups At Muir Middle School the suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students Policies and Procedures as factors for determining whether petitioner presents an unsound educational program and that the petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program See httpachievelausdnetcmslibCACentricityDomainAdministrativeProcedures CharterSchoolsRevisedpdf are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide Exhibits a b Out of School Suspension Events Manul Arts HS and Muir MS In addition the petitioner presents an unsound educational program in that the petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then this student does not need further evaluation of the English language proficiency Petition page This language contravenes the requirement that if the answers to any of the first three questions on the HLS indicate a language other than English or a combination of English and another language the student is assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements Ed Code b Element Educational Program cid The petition describes a process for identifying English Learners that is inconsistent with both legal requirements and District policy The petition states that upon reviewing a students Home Language Survey HLS the school would conduct an evaluation of the potential English Learners academic history If the students academic performance is on par with grade level peers and there are no indications that limited English proficiency has been a barrier to the students learning then this student does not need further evaluation of the English language proficiency Petition page This language contravenes the requirement that if the answers to any of the first three questions on the HLS indicate a language other than English or a combination of English and another language the student is assessed with the California English Language Development Test CELDT or any successor state assessment to measure his or her level of English proficiency cid The petition does not include specific descriptions of a welldeveloped English language acquisition program or the services and supports to be provided to English Learners including instructional strategies and interventions for Long Term English Learners LTELs Element Admission Requirements cid The lottery preferences in the petition providing higher priority for siblings and children of employees over students who reside in the District is inconsistent with the Education Code which requires that in the event of a public random drawing preference must be extended to pupils who reside in the school district Other preferences such as siblings and children of employees are discretionary preferences which are secondary in the order of lottery priorities Ed Code section dB Element Procedures by which Pupils Can be Suspended or Expelled cid The petition does not explicitly delineate mandatory versus discretionary grounds for suspension and expulsion which could lead to inconsistent implementation of disciplinary procedures cid The petition lists as discretionary grounds for suspension the disruption of school activities or otherwise willfully defied the valid authority of supervisors teachers administrators school officials or other school personnel engaged in the performance of their duties This is inconsistent with the LAUSDs Discipline Foundation Policy SchoolWide Positive Behavior Intervention and Support resulting from the Board Resolution School Discipline Policy and School Climate Bill of Rights made applicable to charter schools that are authorized by the District The policy requires alternatives to suspension and positive behavior intervention and supports and that no student will be suspended or expelled for willful defiance cid The suspension appeal process identifies the Principal as the administrator to hear and decide an appeal To assure due process rights of students the same person imposing the suspension should not be responsible for hearing appeals cid The expulsion appeal process identifies the same Board Discipline Committee to hear the underlying expulsion hearing and the appeal This description of the expulsion appeal process does not ensure due process if the same hearing board determines the results of the appeal t n e v E p s u S p o r p s i D e t a R d t S e g n S i l t n e v E p s u S e

Support of Denial of the Charter Petition for LAs Promise Charter Middle School By the Los Angeles Unified School District BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT December Postponed to January I INTRODUCTION The Charter Schools Division CSD presents these supplemental findings of fact for the denial of the petition of LAs Promise Middle School On December the recommendation for the denial of the charter petition for LAs Promise Middle School and the adoption of the findings of fact in support of denial was agendized before the Board of Education On December the District and LAs Promise executed and signed a waiver of timelines and extension for the consideration of the petition to January On December the CSD met with the LAs Promise lead petitioner team to discuss and address the concerns raised by the District in the findings of fact The CSD also considered documentation provided by LAs Promise as well as additional information from the District Based on further review of the information and discussion with LAs Promise the CSD maintains its recommendation that the petition be denied The CSD remains concerned with some of the organizations systems in the areas shared to LAs Promise Leadership and which are the center for the denial recommendations II SUPPLEMENTAL FINDINGS OF FACT The CSD presents these supplemental findings of fact based on additional discussions with lead petitioner and review of District records These supplemental findings should be considered in conjunction with the Findings of Fact presented to the Board on December Petitioners are Demonstrably Unlikely to Successfully Implement the Educational Program In addition to the December Findings of Fact the Superintendent issued a board informative regarding collaborative strategies for Muir Middle School one of the schools operated by LAs Promise pursuant to the Network Partner MOU The board informative summarized a meeting held on December with LAs Promise several leaders from District divisions Local District West UTLA Superintendent Cortines Deputy Superintendent King and Chief of Staff for Board District The group discussed primary concerns over student discipline and need for collaboration between staff and administration Various strategies were discussed to address targeted interventions for students with frequent behavior issues See Board Informative December This meeting exemplifies the systemic issues and rationale raised in the Findings of Fact that the organizations record of performance indicate that LAs Promise needs to stay focused on improving its current schools in order to sustain and build on recent gains and to institute the systemic corrective steps necessary to ensure that its programs and operations meet cidcidcid the needs of all students The student discipline issue is of particular importance since suspension data at Muir Middle School shows that suspension event rate for African American students in is almost four times the event rate schoolwide an event rate for students with disabilities means that these students are suspended almost three times as often as all students schoolwide See Exhibits a b from December Findings of Fact Out of School Suspension Events Manual Arts HS and Muir MS Furthermore On December an Interoffice Correspondence was sent to Ms Veronica Melvin by Ms Hilda Maldonado providing an update on the Manual Arts High School compliance matters with the implementation of a comprehensive and compliant English language development program for all English learners student placement schedules individual student plans and the spring master schedule See Interoffice Correspondence December Of the three items referenced in the correspondence two were still ongoing cidcidcid

Meeting INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Los Angeles Unified School District Office of General Counsel INFORMATIVE TO Members Board of Education DATE November FROM Ramon C Cortines Superintendent of Schools SUBJECT CHARTER PETITION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DENIAL OF LAS PROMISE PETITIONS AND APPROVAL OF ALLIANCE RENEWAL PETITIONS This board informative is to apprise the Board regarding Staff recommendations for two new petitions from LAs Promise and six renewal petitions from the Alliance College Ready Public Schools which are agendized for the December meeting LAs Promise Charter Petitions LAs Promise has submitted two petitions for the establishment of two new independent charter schoolsone middle school and one high schoolwith proposed locations in Board District As the Board knows LAs Promise is a lead partner pursuant to the Lead Partner Memorandum of Understanding MOU and manages the daily operations of three District schools according to the terms of the MOU Those schools are Manual Arts High School West Adams Preparatory High School and Muir Middle School The Charter Schools Division is recommending the denial of the two charter petitions The board report and the findings of fact in support of the denial outline the specific reasons for the denial I support Staff recommendation especially in light of a corrective action letter I sent in October addressing concerns that English Learner students from Manual Arts HS have not been placed in the appropriate English Language Development courses In addition the schools academic performance data shows that for the past three years all three schools under LAs Promise have failed to meet by increasingly large margins any of the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives AMAOs for English Learners LAs Promise provides support as a lead partner through its own fundraising and does not receive ADA revenues Presumably establishment of charter schools would provide them with greater autonomies and revenues to operate more schools However as stated in the findings to deny the school although the schools have experienced overall academic growth since becoming partnership schools and have shown some recent improvement in the academic achievement of their significant subgroups the organizations record of performance indicate that LAs Promise Doc This document is protected by the attorneyclient privilege

INFORMATIVE DATE December SUBJECT CONTRACTOR NAME CALIFORNIA EDUCATION PARTNERS CONTRACT NO AMOUNT REQUEST FOR RATIFICATION OF AFTER THE FACT CONTRACT BACKGROUND On August the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD was awarded an NCLB Waiver as a member of the California Office to Reform Education CORE a consortium of ten California districts eight of which formed a partnership to craft the waiver application to the United States Department of Education USDE This waiver allows flexibility pertaining to various aspects of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA formerly NCLB and transitions our district into a new accountability system Overall this waiver supports our work in the following ways cid Creates infrastructure to support collaboration across schools and districts to build knowledge and share practices in support of our students becoming college and career ready cid Creates a new accountability system that cid cid cid cid cid recognizes performance growth bases evaluation of school performance on multiple measures including academics socialemotional factors and school culture and climate factors captures positive or negative changes in school achievement gaps invites shared responsibility of accountability across and within districts continues to hold Title I schools accountable for academic growth and subsequent mandated improvement efforts however in the new system Title I schools are now identified and recognized for increased student achievement cid Aligns with our current district initiative to support the Common Core rollout cid Aligns with our current district initiatives to support Teacher and Leadership development and evaluation Why is this necessary Six California school districts Fresno Long Beach Los Angeles Oakland San Francisco and Santa Ana unified school districts representing more than a million students have come together to form a learning cooperative called the California Office to Reform Education Members Board of Education Ramon Cortines Superintendent of Schools December CORE The Districts are focused on deep learning and sharing practices in the two critical areas effective implementation of the Common Core State Standards and building social capital In order to further their work the Districts collectively decided to seek a waiver from the NCLB and organized a process to include Local Education Agencies LEAs throughout the state that share a commitment to this reform work California Education Partners operates as a nonprofit organization with a small staff whom specifically focus on supporting the six participating districts to implement the various elements of the waiver Please see below for a more specific outline of the services and support provided to LAUSD by CORE California Education

the CORE School Support Team Supplemental support providers will bill only for direct support to LAUSD administrators and school staff in the development and implementation of the School Pairing and Communities of Practice programs Why is this firm selected California Education Partners is a nonprofit organization and is a sole source vendor Why is this an after the fact Services needed to be implemented in a very short period of time Also this is a cleanup from a previous location Public School Choice that is now closed The invoice was given to us by the vendor on June and services were for a CORE Waiver Pairing Institute that occurred on January What would happen if this were not approved If this contract is not approved then our CORE Waiver schools participating in the School Pairing and Community of Practice Programs would not have received technical assistance to implement certain aspects of the CORE waiver and LAUSD would not have fulfilled critical requirements of the waiver potentially falling out of compliance thereby running the risk of being asked not to participate in the waiver going forward What are the terms of the proposed agreement The terms of this

requirements for reimbursable meals The intent of Food Services Division is to streamline the purchasing process and obtain better pricing by moving toward strategicallysourced food suppliers As you may know Procurement Services reissued a bid for chicken and chicken products The chicken was rebid in order to increase competition and provide the district more options in meeting the needs and expectations of the Districts Good Food Procurement Policy The re launch of the solicitation allowed for increased competition by changing the minimum requirements to include emphasis on the Good Food

resulted in awarding seven of the eight most commonly served chicken items on the Districts current menu For three of the most popular items with students there was only one proposal received Of the requirements used to evaluate the proposers price along with the Good Food Procurement Pledge plan were significant components Part of the price included the opportunity to utilize the Divisions allocation of entitlement in dollar equivalents used to determine commodities from the United States Department of Agriculture USDA These vendors will utilize commodity funds to continue to drive costs down and receive the full value of our entitlement dollars resulting in the receipt of commercial products all year long and reducing the nonvalueadded costs to the District Why do we need to do

single gender school approved the submission of a waiver request to the SBE to allow for GALS operation of a single gender school See BR GALS single gender admissions policy is designed to decrease the opportunity gap and to increase the physical emotional and academic achievement of the protected populations eg minority and lowincome female students served by GALS Title IX of the Education Amendments of Title IX has a permissive clause to allow the establishment of single gender public elementary or secondary schools Since California law contains nondiscrimination provisions in the Education Code the District submitted a waiver request in the event it is necessary On July the California Department of Educations Waiver Office sent written notification that upon review of the waiver request the CDE and the SBE staff do not find that the District has provided a need for a waiver and that LAUSD and GALS must ensure requirements regarding that nondiscrimination See attached letter from CDE the school complies with state and federal statutory and constitutional CDEs Charter Schools Division has instructed GALS and the District that it would need the Board of Education to approve the charter petition without conditions in order to issue a CDS number for the charter school Accordingly this request is being made to approve the GALS charter petition without conditions

charter schools debts or obligations as long as the school district complies with all oversight responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and oversight responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter schools petition or operations with significant financial implications would require District approval prior to implementation Petition approval is also contingent upon adequate liability insurance coverage GALS has selected LAUSD SELPA Option Charter Schools fair share contribution for special education will be of the Districts general fund contribution rate per ADA for the first fiscal year of the charter petition period which will be paid from the Charter Schools Local Control Funding Formula LCFF funds or other unrestricted revenue sources This formula will increase by for each subsequent fiscal year of the charter petition period until the applicable percentage reaches For the remainder of the

schools but now attend private allgirls schools One student stated We are the good girls the ones who stay in the back of the classroom take notes never cause problems and get adequate grades But when I was at my LAUSD middle school I didnt know how to ask the teacher questions talk in front of the class or really engage with what I was learning I was always afraid to say anything in case someone made fun of me I had no voice and didnt know how Girls Academic Leadership Academy School Proposal to get one Since Ive been in an allgirls school I have learned to speak up to know that there is no stupid question and to be part of a community of girls all pushing each other to be better On the panel three other girls with similar educational backgrounds agreed with her During questions to the panel on STEM courses the girls further stated that they were not encouraged to go into higher level science and math courses and that there was limited access to robotics programs In LAUSD we do an adequate job of graduating girls but how prepared are they for the rigors of college for critical thinking or simply for asking questions According to the panel girls are not at all well prepared especially in the STEM fields If we look at the data from the California Standards tests girls within LAUSD perform at the same level or above their male peers in math and science while in elementary school However their scores on standardized tests in math and science decline as they progress through our educational system as shown below Chart One Percentage of girls proficient and advanced in

graduation and collegegoing rates through a singlegender model One model for educational reform and equity for young women is singlegender education or all girls schools Until this model was only available in independent or religious schools prohibitive to many families due to the costs associated with these schools On October the Title IX requirements regarding single gender education were modified Arnie Duncan Secretary of Education stated that With respect to requirements for offering singlesex public schools the new regulations also provide more flexibility The former regulations permitted an Local Educational Agency LEA to offer a nonvocational singlesex school if it offered a corresponding school for students of the other sex Under the Departments interpretation of the former requirements the corresponding school must also have been a singlesex school Under the new regulations an LEA is permitted to offer a singlesex school to students of one sex if it provides a substantially equal school to students excluded from the singlesex school based on sex but that school may be either single sex or coeducational The new regulations also allow a nonvocational public charter school that is a singleschool LEA under State law an exemption from the requirement to provide a substantially equal school for students of the excluded sex Dear Colleague Letter Following the changes in the amendment the number of public schools offering single gender education has skyrocketed In only four public schools in the nation offered singlegender education by public singlegender

parental education Although research on singlesex schools is still emerging studies have pointed to the improved academic achievement of girls enrolled in singlesex environment According to SingleSex Versus Coeducational Schooling A Systematic Review a report released by the US Department of Education researchers examined how studying in singlesex schools affects academic achievement and other outcomes by evaluating forty research studies In the study researchers found positive effects of singlesex schooling on allsubject achievement tests In addition to improved academic achievement other studies have also demonstrated that girls experience improved selfesteem and focus when enrolled in a singlesex environment J Granleese and S Joseph SelfPerception Profile of Adolescent Girls at a SingleSex and a MixedSex School Journal of Genetic Psychology Research has also shown girls needs are not being adequately met in coeducational classrooms and that girls in coeducational schools fare particularly poorly on measures of selfesteem and selfefficacy Sax These benefits help reduce the kinds of choices that girls suffering from low selfesteem make such as engaging in delinquency and running away from home It is our professional judgment that students thrive in environments in which they can focus on developing a positive sense of selfesteem and healthy relationships and our belief that a singlegender school is the best means to achieve this environment Researchers have also posited that early differences in the treatment of girls and boys can result in enduring learning patterns Because children spend more time with their teachers than with any other adult other than their parents teachers expectations and actions have a profound effect on student achievement and selfesteem Skolnick J How to Encourage Girls in Math and Science Strategies For Parents and Educators Englewood Cliffs NJ PrenticeHall The things teachers say and do not say in the classroom how they

is projected to grow percent between and and employment in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM occupations is expected to increase by Technology works Bay Area Economic Institute Ian Hathaway Dec However currently women only account for about of those jobs and tend to stay in the lower level entry positions longer than men NCWIT Girls Academic Leadership Academy School Proposal Women in IT The Facts Sept This research highlights the need for female students in LAUSD to be immersed in technology The lack of women in the fields of science engineering and math has also recently garnered national attention and has been identified as an important area for improvement by the highest levels of government In February shortly after his State of the Union address President Barack Obama stated One of the things that I really strongly believe in is that we need to have more girls interested in math science and engineering Weve got half the population that is way underrepresented in those fields and that means that weve got a whole bunch of talentnot being encouraged the way they need to According to the White Houses Office of Science and Technology Policy Supporting women STEM students and researchers is not only an essential part of Americas strategy to outinnovate outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world it is also important to women themselves Women in STEM jobs earn percent more than those in nonSTEM occupations and experience a smaller wage gap relative to men And STEM careers offer women the opportunity to engage in some of the most exciting realms of discovery and technological innovation Increasing opportunities for women in these fields is an important step towards realizing greater economic success and equality for women across the board GALA in consultation with educational partners including College Board USC School of Engineering UCLA School of Computer Science and Mount Saint Marys College have developed a sequential pathway in computer science from grades an accelerated common core pathway in math and a sequential highlevel pathway in science High school requirements will include four years in math and science as well as AP courses Development of voice and leadership skills for girls In her book Lean In Random House author and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg identifies a dearth of women in leadership positions Although women represent over of college graduates only Fortune CEOs are women and only hold executive officer positions Some studies suggest that from a very early age boys are encouraged to take charge and offer their opinions These patterns persist into adulthood and are often internalized so that young women silence themselves and do not seek out challenging leadership positions Ms Sandberg wrote her book as a call to action to help young women to retain their voice and to provide better mentoring and leadership opportunities for women The need for deliberately building leadership skills throughout the curriculum is underscored by this recent research straight from industry In an allgirls school the opportunities for leadership are increased as only girls can be in the position of leadership However the development of leadership skills will be a conscious endeavor through class instructional methods the use of advisories peer leadership structures honor code structure a

subject teams to develop a critical friends process Training will be provided through the Critical Friends Program at Wildwood School in developing a working and reflective group to focus on the art of teaching In addition as part of the National Coalition of Girls Schools teachers will have access to a large community of teachers in girls schools to discuss instructional methods that work best for girls Traditional assessment of success such as performance assessments grade evaluation and standards will be evaluated but the nontraditional will also be discussed The goal is to develop a collaborative safe but challenging atmosphere that will help each teacher become the best at hisher craft Although the administrators will participate in the UTLA agreed upon evaluation process they will serve as professional coaches of good teaching rather than solely evaluators In addition after the initial start up years when much of their time and attention is needed out of the classroom administrators will teach at least one class to stay current in the ongoing practice of teaching Recognizing that time organization and fatigue take a toll on collaborative planning structures will be established to ensure that collaborative time is available to teachers The spring and summer prior to the initial opening of GALA teachers will participate in collaborative planning time During the school year when possible teachers will have common planning time built into their schedule Several school retreats and grade levelsubject level retreats will be planned for ongoing review of professional practice Design Team Capacity The Gala Design team has been in formation for several years beginning with conversations between female educators regarding the role of women in educational

calendar If funding allows teachers and students will be required to participate in a summer program prior to the start of the school year The summer program initially will involve teachers and students in advisories getting to know one another and working on study habits and skill building activities After the startup year the summer experience will focus on students new to the school all th grade students In addition pupil free days will be planned at the start of each semester for reflection professional development and participation in critical friends groups The school day will be structured to include intervention and enrichment The use of advisory to open and close the school day will connect students to the school by building a familylike atmosphere This is especially crucial as students navigate the middle school years Traditionally schools are structured with a six period day GALA has added in a seventh period that will be used for intervention collaboration and competition In middle school the th period will follow an alternating day schedule with three days of the week Tuesday Thursday Friday devoted to academic collaboration intervention and enrichment support and two days Monday and Thursday devoted to computer instruction On collaboration days the th period will be designed fairly flexibly Students will be grouped together based on teacher and student identified needs Students who need extra instruction will be grouped together for intervention English Learners may have their English Language Development during this time period Students who simply need a quiet place to work on homework or do research will be provided an opportunity Students who are participating in academic competitions such as debate robotics mathletes and academic decathlon may use this time to prepare for competitions For the other two days a week middle school students will have the computer sequence of courses intended to prepare students for the high school required sequence of computer courses In high school students may use this time period to complete online credit recovery as needed or to complete higher level and Advanced Placement courses not

Master Schedule see Attachment C GALA will meet the allocation norm for year one However the Master Schedule is built on one of the foundational ideas of GALA that students need personalized attention particularly during the transition years in th and th grades The norm for core academic classes in th and th grade at GALA is to In th and th grade GALA will require an additional position The supplemental positions may be paid for with additional Title One and EL funding In addition GALA is seeking to be recognized as a Teach for America TFA training school which could assist with the need for additional teachers It is also anticipated that GALA will bring in students who are currently enrolled in private schools and charter schools adding additional ADA money to the District which might offset the additional teacher administrative and clerical needs As the school grows by one grade per year the need for additional teachers will grow exponentially GALA is requesting the following offnorm positions to assist in its initial year of operation However GALA understands that additional positions would need to be considered and approved among other off Girls Academic Leadership Academy School Proposal norm requests throughout the District Assistant Principal an additional clerical position a fulltime counselor an English Learner Bilingual and testing coordinator

Program Los Angeles Leadership Primary Academy operated by The Los Angeles Leadership Academy was originally approved by the Board of Education on April to serve K students For the proposed charter term the school plans to serve up to students in TK through th grade in each of the five years of the charter term This increase in enrollment is to ensure that it can serve all of its current students as they move up through the grades During the current charter term of the schools student body has reflected the community in which it operates According to October CDE data the schools demographics are approximately Latino African American White English Learners and Students Qualifying for Free and Reduced Meals Please see October CALPADS Demographics with Comparison Schools in Los Angeles Leadership Primary Academy Summary of Charter School Performance LALPAs SpanishEnglish dual language immersion schoolwide program is designed to meet the needs of all learners including English learners socioeconomically disadvantaged students students with disabilities and students in other subgroups as well as students performing below at and above grade level Content instruction is provided in the two languages throughout the instructional day in kindergarten through fifth grade with instruction in Spanish provided at least of the time In accordance with the provisions of the Districts English Learner Master Plan LALPA has opted to implement its own English Learner Master Plan and has provided the requisite annual certification and supporting documentation to the Charter Schools Division LALPA has instituted as part of its English Language Development program a minute dedicated daily block of English language development instruction Los Angeles Leadership Primary Academy also provides a differentiated instructional program and a wide variety of enrichment opportunities for high achieving students The school has shared that while it historically has not actively identified GATE students it has implemented specific instructional strategies for serving the academic needs for students that are achieving above grade level Starting this academic school year LALPA has also instituted a new system led by the schools Director of Student Support Services for identifying and serving the needs of GATE students Once LALPA has completed its initial process of compiling and analyzing relevant data from various sources such as state standardized tests periodic benchmark test results grades and teacher input through the end of the first benchmark period of the school will identify and serve students who are referred for one of the following accelerated learner categories High Achievement Ability and Leadership Ability In addition LALPAs Director of Student Services will hold a GATE parent advisory meeting on a monthly basis The school will provide its accelerated learners with increased opportunities to reach beyond the content area during class time through implementation of GATE strategies that are embedded in the core instruction Furthermore LALPA will provide additional opportunities such as monthly activities options to participate in interest clubs andor science and art fairs accelerated courses student portfolios and annual showcases to continue to meet the needs of its high achieving population Record of Performance Although LALPA experienced both academic and operational challenges in its first three years during the leadership that has instituted a school year the governing board appointed new organizational Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version comprehensive turnaround plan which has already yielded improved outcomes for students As discussed below internal assessment data from administration of Northwest Evaluation Association NWEA assessments in English Spanish and math shows measurable academic growth schoolwide and for the schools significant student subgroups in grades K The school just added its fifth grade this year CSD staff observation at the annual oversight visit to the school this fall confirms that the school has made notable positive improvements in the schools implementation of its dual language and Structured English Immersion programs and has a refocused emphasis on building literacy skills through the schools Readers and Writers Workshop curriculum In a November letter of support for the school the teaching staffs CTA representative corroborates the beneficial impact of the recent change in leadership on the school culture operations and educational program Minimal state standardized test data is available to assess LALPA student academic achievement and progress Since the school opened in it has implemented a slowgrowth rollout model of adding one grade per year starting with kindergarten and first grade students in In its second year LALPA conducted the states final administration of the CSTs in English and mathematics for its first cohort of second graders The schools second grade students earned a Growth API score of and a Growth API State Rank of reflecting a rate of of students scoring Proficient or Advanced in ELA This rate was similar to the Resident Schools Median of In Math of the schools second graders scored Proficient or Advanced a rate well below the Resident School Median of Due to the combination of LALPAs slow growth model and the temporary suspension of the states CST standardized testing program the school is able to provide only one year of CSTAPI baseline results Data are therefore not available to meet the first three minimum academic performance criteria for renewal set forth in Education Code section b It is also difficult to determine to what extent the school has met the fourth criterion due to the lack of recent comparison data and the statistically small sample size of students that produced the schools CST results Analysis of the schools internal assessment data does provide some indication however to the academic performance of other elementary schools As discussed below according to the widely accepted NWEA normative assessments for the most part LALPA students are performing at expected levels for their respective grades the schools overall academic performance is at least equal that LALPAs internal standardized assessment data shows that the school has achieved positive academic achievement and growth schoolwide and for its student subgroups Starting in the school year the school instituted a schoolwide NWEA assessment program in which the school has administered CPAA Childrens Progress Academic Assessment assessments in Spanish and mathematics for its K students and MAP Measures of Academic Progress assessments in English and mathematics for its students in grades This battery of assessments is given three times per academic year This year the school is adding the CPAA English assessment for its primary grade students The results of the endofyear NWEA assessments show overall positive academic achievement and growth According to the NWEA performance scales LALPA students in K have achieved at or slightly below expected levels of performance and growth for their respective grades For example under the CPAA Spring Scale performance scores of are rated as At Expectation scores of are Approaching Expectation and scores of are Below Expectation As shown in the tables below LAPLA kindergarten students scored At Expectation in Spanish listening phonicswriting phonemic awareness and reading In mathematics

in literacy and math Second grade earned similar results with the exception of a dip in reading scores LALPA also achieved academic growth in the upper grades According to the NWEA the MAP assessments normed growth expectations for third and fourth grades range from to points LALPAs third grade endofyear MAP data shows a point growth in reading a point growth in language usage and a point growth in mathematics Likewise the schools fourth grade demonstrated a point growth in reading and a point growth in mathematics these students did not demonstrate growth however in language usage SB requires the District to give extra consideration to increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school in determining whether to grant a charter renewal LALPAs data shows that the schools socioeconomically disadvantaged students Latino students English learners and students with disabilities have achieved academic growth in English Spanish and mathematics CPAA Spanish and mathematics testing results show that K students in subgroups have made academic progress at expected levels in both subjects second grade students have achieved growth at expected levels in most areas of both subjects In the upper grades the NWEA MAP data disaggregated for English learners and students with disabilities shows increases in academic performance in English and mathematics of to points Please see Los Angeles Leadership Primary Academy Summary of Charter School Performance LALPA attributes its recent academic improvement to last years change in top leadership and resulting re focus on full implementation of the Common Corebased curriculum and instructional practices set forth in the schools charter Professional development at the school emphasizes key skills necessary to successfully implement the schools program including the collection and analysis of data and a continual emphasis on teacher collaboration The school is closely monitoring and providing immediate support for all of its subgroups of students so that they continue to demonstrate improvement in academic achievement in both English and mathematics Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version LALPA also now provides its students with access to technologybased learning opportunities including online learning programs such as STMath and RAZkids to engage in interactive tasks assigned by the teacher Students use mobile laptops and iPads with Google Classroom and Google Apps to collaborate create take quick assessments and manage work in progress Teachers are presentations conduct surveys implementing the SAMR Substitution Augmentation Modification and Redefinition model for integrating technology into teaching and

Operations and the rating of Developing in Student Achievement and Educational Performance Recommended Benchmarks In order to ensure that the school sustains and continues to build on its recent improvements CSD staff recommends that the Board issue academic and operational benchmarks In the area of academic performance LALPA will be required to provide the Charter Schools Division with an annual academic performance analysis and selfreflection due no later than October that reports on the schools progress toward the performance targets identified in its charter and LCAP including but not limited to schoolwide and subgroup performance and progress as measured by the Smarter Balanced Assessments CELDT other state standardized measures of performance and the schools internal assessments In addition staff recommends an operational benchmark to require LALPA to provide the Charter Schools Division with annual verification within days of the schools timely submission to CALPADS of all data related to English learner reclassification The schools lower annual oversight ratings in the category of Student Achievement and Educational Performance have been due in part to errors and omissions made under the organizations previous leadership in reporting CELDT scores and reclassification rates in and in LALPA has already provided to the Charter Schools Division a written description of the schools new system for accurate and timely reporting of reclassification information in CALPADS in alignment with CALPADS submission windows for each year of the charter term and no later than December for this year It is important to note that the schoolorganizations new Executive Director has restructured compliance operations In addition Los Angeles Leadership Academy has hired a Director of Development and at the school site Compliance and a Director of Student Support Services to monitor all operational compliance at the school site level with consistent reporting within CALPADS as one of the organizations top priorities The new leadership team has also conducted an inhouse audit to ensure that English learners have been correctly classified based on information from prior years Furthermore the school has submitted documentation to the CSD confirming that the CELDT tests have been administered and submitted to the CDE Due Diligence Current Los Angeles Leadership Primary Academy Governing Board members completed questionnaires regarding conflicts of interest A due diligence review of LALPA and its governing organization school leaders and

TAB Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Ave Los Angeles CA Board of Education Report File Rep Version Approval of the Material Revision of the Charter for Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts to Remove th grade and Change Lottery Preferences Action Proposed Staff recommends the approval of the material revision of the charter for Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts which is located in Board District and Local District Central LDC effective upon Board approval of the material revision and concurrent with the renewal petition See BR for related renewal action Background On November Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts submitted a request for a material revision in conjunction with a renewal petition submitted November The proposed material revision seeks to change the order of lottery preferences as described below as well as remove grade so that the school would serve grades TK beginning in the school year Removal of th Grade The removal of th grade has been prompted due to the th grade enrollment considerably dropping after th grade The school currently serves less than sixth graders creating a challenge to utilize a collaborative planning model and to meet the students best interest for a timely placement in a middle school program Proposed New Order for Lottery Preferences Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts an elementary school that has struggled with achieving a diverse student body has made efforts to improve diversity through the inclusion of lottery preferences intended to yield a total that better reflects the demographics of the community and serve more socioeconomically enrollment disadvantaged students The proposed material revision is seeking to reorder the lottery preferences currently in the schools approved charter in an effort to increase the schools population of students eligible for free and reduced lunch In the school was approved for a material revision to include lottery preferences that were aimed to diversify demographics and represent the neighborhood The school analyzed results of the annual lottery and found that most enrollments of students residing in the Glassell Park Elementary attendance boundary were of students not eligible for the National School Lunch Program NSLP Accordingly the proposed order of admission preferences is as follows I Students who are currently attending the charter school and pupils who reside in LAUSD II Siblings of students already attending the school III Children of school personnel and LFCSA Board of Directors who reside or work in the territorial jurisdiction of the LAUSD up to limit IV Students eligible for the National Free Reduced Lunch Program in lottery order V Students who are currently enrolled in Glassell Park Elementary School and to students who reside in the Glassell Park Elementary School attendance area in lottery order VI Students residing in California but not residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the LAUSD Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version applicable only during period of SB grant The material revision amends all provisions in the charter pertaining to grade six and the lottery preferences Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts LFCSA was originally approved by the Board of Education on June and renewed again with demographic targets on March to serve students in grades K through In addition to this material revision the school is also seeking renewal at the Board of Educations meeting on January See BR Expected Outcomes Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts LFCSA is expected to operate its charter school in a manner consistent with local state and federal ordinances laws and regulations and with the terms and conditions set forth in its charter Board Options and Consequences Yes The approval of the material revision of the charter would grant Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts the right to continue to operate as a charter school under the terms of the charter as amended for the remainder of its charter term No The denial of the material revision of the charter would result in Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts continuing to operate under the terms of its current charter Policy Implications There are no policy implications at this time Budget Impact State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases Under Education Code section c a school district that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated by or as a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not held liable for the charter schools debts or obligations as long as the school district complies with all oversight responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and oversight responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter schools petition or operations with significant financial implications would require District approval prior to implementation Approval of the material revision is also contingent upon adequate liability insurance coverage Issues and Analysis If all pending issues if any are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting the Office of General Counsel may recommend the denial of the material revision Attachments Desegregation Impact Statement Executive Summary Material Revision Informatives Not applicable Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on

Local District CENTRAL Current Enrollment and Grade Levels Type of Charter TK Independent StartUp Approved Enrollment Type of Site Private Staff Recommendation Approval Brief Summary of Rationale cid cid When students reach th grade at Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts many families leave to attend middle schools which begin at th grade As a result there is an enrollment drop to less than students in this grade level This creates challenges for the collaborative planning model at the school If a student were to stay till th grade it may result in an untimely placement in a middle school program Therefore the school requests to remove the th grade cid The school continues to reflect upon practices to improve student diversity After implementing changes to lottery preferences in the school found that the school did not obtain many students that came into the lottery from the Glassell Park Elementary School preference who also were eligible for free and reduced lunch The school has however increased their enrollment of students eligible for free and reduced meals who reside in other parts of the District In order to continue to build the population of students who may

the Renewal of the Charter for Multicultural Learning Center [Public Hearing] Action Proposed Staff recommends approval with benchmarks of the renewal of the charter for Multicultural Learning Center MLC located in Board District and Local District Northwest LDNW for five years with instructional and operational benchmarks beginning July until June to serve students in grades TK in each year of the charter term Background Multicultural Learning Center serves students in grades K in Board District Local District Northwest at De Soto Avenue Canoga Park CA The schools current enrollment is students in grades K The school is located on a private site On October Multicultural Learning Center submitted its charter renewal petition application to the Charter Schools Division The charter petition and supporting documents were reviewed by staff of the Charter Schools Division the Office of the General Counsel and other District offices Pursuant to a waiver mutually agreed upon and executed by petitioners and the District the timeline for Board action on this petition has been extended to January Renewal Requirements Upon submission the District reviews each renewal petition application to determine whether the school has met the requirements for renewal set forth in Education Code sections and The Districts review process includes the following Determination whether the charter school meets the minimum academic performance criteria for renewal eligibility Ed Code b Analysis of the schools academic performance data to determine whether and to what extent the school has produced increases in academic achievement for all numerically significant subgroups of students served by the charter school Ed Code a Review of the charter petition to assess the soundness of the described educational program ensure it contains the required affirmations and ensure it contains reasonably comprehensive descriptions of specific elements Ed Code b and Assessment whether the petitioners are demonstrably likely to successfully implement the program which includes review of the schools record of past performance and future plans regarding academics finances and operations as demonstrated in part by the results of annual Charter Schools Division oversight and the schools record of achievement on state standardized assessments Ed Code b CCR Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version Pursuant to the requirements of SB the District shall consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant a charter renewal Ed Code aA Based on the results of the District review process staff assesses that Multicultural Learning Center has met the statutory requirements for renewal History Demographics and Educational Program Multicultural Learning Center MLC was originally approved by the Board of Education to begin operation in the school year It has since been renewed on May and again on February For the proposed charter term the school plans to continue serving up to students in grades K in each of the five years of the charter term During the current charter term of MLC the schools student body has mostly reflected the community in which it operates According to October CDE data the schools demographics are approximately Latino African American White English Learners and Students Qualifying for Free and Reduced Meals The school has had a smaller population of students qualifying for free and reduced meals than the Resident Schools Median of and the LAUSD Similar Schools Median of for this same subgroup The school also has had a smaller GATE population than the resident and similar school median rates of While the school has identified GATE students it historically has initiated the process predominantly upon parent request The school is now working on creating a schoolwide system utilizing data for earlier identification of students performing above grade level to increase opportunities for these students Please see October CALPADS Demographics with Comparison Schools in Multicultural Learning Center Summary of Charter School Performance For high achieving students MLCs educational program has provided differentiated opportunities such as moving students up a grade level for math class utilizing rubrics aligned to Kaplans Depth Of Knowledge with tasks that provide opportunity to reach higher cognitive levels and implementing leveled reading programs and ST Math which allow students to accelerate at their own pace All multicultural students are part of the schools dual immersion program Kindergarten through second grade receive instruction in all subjects in Spanish In third grade it is the first formal introduction to reading and writing in English as English Language arts is split in instruction time between Spanish and English In fourth grade students continue in Spanish with the addition of English during social studies In fifth grade instruction in English is added to science and the arts At this point instructional time is about Spanish and English Sixth through eighth grade add English instruction to math time The schools SpanishEnglish dual immersion educational program is designed to meet the needs of all learners including English learners socioeconomically disadvantaged students students with disabilities and students in other subgroups as well as students performing below at and above grade level In accordance with the provisions of the Districts English Learner Master Plan MLC has opted to implement its own English Learner Master Plan and has provided the requisite annual certification and supporting documentation to the Charter Schools Division MLCs English Learner population at is above the LAUSD Similar Schools Median of and below the Resident School Median of MLC teachers consistently use Guided Language Acquisition Design GLAD strategies not only to support English Learners but also in support of the schools dual language program which develops language proficiency in both English and Spanish MLCs reported English learner reclassification rates have been inconsistent The school states that it has reclassified students each year and that the in its CALPADS data for and is due to reporting difficulties In the school reclassified and exceeded the District rate of The schools Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version administrative team has worked with the CDE to better understand CALPADS reporting processes for reclassification to ensure the school meets the CALPADS timelines Staff therefore recommends an operational benchmark throughout the charter term for this area On February as part of its renewal of the charter for Multicultural Learning Center the LAUSD Board assigned benchmarks for comparative student performance and growth over time as well as specific benchmarks for the schools unique dual language immersion model The CSD has continued monitoring these benchmarks through ongoing oversight During the period of suspension of the states CST assessments as part of the transition to the new California content and performance standards CSD staff has reviewed the schools internal data and other performance measures to gauge the schools progress toward the benchmarks The school has had mixed academic results on the benchmarks based on available data Of the benchmarks the school met one partially met four and did not meet three of the benchmarks in place The ninth benchmark For example MLC did not meet was not tallied because it was directly linked to suspended CST testing established comparative benchmarks for proficient and advanced academic performance rates The school did meet the grade proficiency benchmark for English Learners and RFEPs for each year of the term This is consistent with expectations that students in the higher grade levels of the program will show increased levels of proficiency MLC partially met Title III AMAO Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives targets for its English learners As discussed above although the school has inconsistently reported its reclassification rates which will be addressed through continued benchmarks the two years of data that were adequately reported did meet the reclassification benchmark Please see Multicultural Learning Center Executive Summary for the results of all benchmarks Record of Performance Overall Multicultural Learning Center has achieved a solid record of academic performance In MLC earned a schoolwide Growth API of a point increase from its Base API of and the following Growth APIs for its numerically significant subgroups Latino an point growth Socioeconomically Disadvantaged a point growth and English Learners a point growth MLCs growth API is equivalent to the resident API growth of points and exceeds the similar schools median growth of On the CSTs MLC performed slightly higher than resident school performance in English Language Arts with proficient and advanced compared to the Resident School Median and lower than the LAUSD Similar School Median of In math MLC performed below the proficient and advanced percentages for both the resident and similar school medians While MLC scored proficient and advanced the resident schools had a median score of and the similar schools had a median score of To improve math achievement the school has invested in professional development through Math ED Specialists the last three years and recently has engaged Math Trailblazers for newly purchased curriculum Math intervention is provided during the day and afterschool for targeted students Common Core math instruction is delivered utilizing CPM College Preparatory Math for middle school and ST Math for the elementary grades Based on tenets of the dual immersion model the school confirms that proficiency increases as students move up through grade levels MLCs CST data mirrors this expectation as shown in the chart below MLC CST ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS PROFICIENT AND ADVANCED GRADE GRADE Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by Legistar File Rep Version GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE GRADE The school shares that research and the schools experience show that the effectiveness of the bilingual model of education often takes several years to manifest in standard student achievement measures Comparisons of achievement data in the lower grade levels may indicate performance at levels less than or equivalent to other schools but as the students reach the upper elementary grades and middle school they begin to outperform other schools while at the same time developing proficiency in a second language The chart below which follows a cohort from nd grade to th grade shows that MLCs dual immersion program is leading to high levels of student success in the upper grades compared to the District and state averages on the CST in ELA by th grade It also illustrates how a cohort of students increased proficiency rates over time through the elementary grades This cohort data saw an overall proficiency increase from second grade to the eighth grade The school shares that approximately of the eighth graders assessed have attended MLC for more than years The school reports that these outcomes are not surprising given that it is in the third grade of MLCs dual immersion program in which students start receiving instruction in English in reading and in writing School leadership has shared that students in the lower grades predominantly read write and speak in Spanish during instructional minutes It is not until the fifth grade that instructional time in English evens out with instruction in Spanish The programs grade level balances of Spanish and English are kindergarten and first grade SpanishEnglish second grade third grade fourth grade and fifth through eighth grades ELA MLC Proficient and Advanced LAUSD State MLC nd grade CST rd grade CST th grade CST th grade CST th grade CST Performed lower Performed between Outperformed both

students have experienced growth in academic performance In the school met the API Growth targets for all three of its student subgroups The English Learner subgroup increased its API by points The Socioeconomically Disadvantaged increased its API by points The Latino subgroup achieved an increase of points While students with disabilities is not a numerically significant subgroup for the school

the absence of state data However the assessment system was not set up to automatically disaggregate subgroup data The data retrieved for the subgroups of the internal assessment did however show room for growth Several cohorts of CELDT data were analyzed and showed that over a year period of students showed growth in ELD levels or reclassified during that time To support the English Learner population at MLC the school provides pushin services during the English Language Instructional time using a combination of Integrated ELD and Designated ELD The school recently adopted a new ELD curriculum used in K Spotlight aligned to the new ELD standards TK K and grade program is SpanishEnglish Thus minutes of instructional time is in English The content is usually related to social studies and science themes In second grade English development time increases to an hour and adds a component of word study to the integrated instruction It is in the third grade when English instruction increases to and this is during a dedicated English time block In third grade and up designated ELD for small groups takes place according to student levels All teachers develop individual ELD plans for each student that are aligned with ELD goals and standards An ELD checklist is used to monitor progress and growth As part of its statutory responsibilities the CSD conducts annual

Moderna and Prepa Tec Los Angeles are expected to operate its charter schools in a manner consistent with local state and federal ordinances laws and regulations and with the terms and conditions set

a charter school under the terms of the charter as amended for the remainder of its charter term No The denial of the material revision of the charters would result in Academia Moderna and Prepa Tec Los Angeles continuing to operate under the terms of its current charter without clarifying the governance and operational structure of the organization Policy Implications There are no policy implications at this time Budget Impact State income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school and comparable or offsetting expenditure reduction may not occur in such cases Under Education Code section c a school district that grants a charter to a charter school to be operated by or as a nonprofit public benefit corporation is not held liable for the charter schools debts or obligations as long as the school district complies with all oversight responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and oversight responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter schools petition or operations with significant financial implications would require District approval prior to implementation Approval of the material revision is also contingent upon adequate liability insurance coverage Issues and Analysis If all pending issues if any are not resolved at the time of the Board meeting the Office of General Counsel may recommend the denial of the material revision Los Angeles Unified School District Page of Printed on powered by

allows The City School to afford its private facility TCS is currently located in West Pico Blvd Los Angeles CA in Board District Local District WEST LDW and predominantly serves students from West Los Angeles Cheviot Hills Mid City and surrounding areas The City School plans to relocate to a private site in the block of the Motor Ave area for the school year In the event that the move occurs the preference for Richland would no longer be valid and the school would be required to submit a new request for material revision of its admission preferences in order to continue meeting SB eligibility requirements The City School was originally granted its charter by the Board of Education on February and the school opened on July The school was granted its charter to serve students in grades and in its first year and growing to serve students in grades and by June The charter school was later granted a material revision of its charter on March to revise Element to add a lottery

Climate Bill of Rights and AB regarding willful defiance as grounds for suspensionexpulsion The charter school currently serves students in grades The mission of The City School is to facilitate the achievement of middle school aged students who come from underserved populations by providing a highly focused academic program in a community that will create a safe and challenging learning

will need to be submitted to name the resident school within the appropriate attendance area of said location to ensure compliance with The City Schools eligibility for the Charter School Facility Grant Program SB Board Options and Consequences Yes The approval of the material revision of the charter would grant The City School the right to continue to operate as a charter school under the

public high schools require the equivalent of between and yearlong courses Two semester courses equal one yearlong course A yearlong course constitutes one Carnegie unit Semester courses constitute onehalf of a Carnegie unit cid A year of study is two semesters of study in the same or related subject area However local school districts determine the actual organization of instructional time depending on their master schedule Variances apply depending on holidays professional development days and block scheduling Emphasis added One year in California university systems is defined by the body of knowledge that may be attained in a yearlong course The requirements may also be satisfied through exams Advanced Placement SAT etc or by validation For secondary courses that are considered yearlong eg English AB Algebra II AB instructional continuity continues However the number of instructional days between grade marks reporting windows ie week midterm week final will differ where semesters are not balanced In the currently proposed calendar each of the four fall semester course instructional periods would be roughly days shorter than spring semester instructional periods

School courses are hours long versus semester days in an evenly balanced school year Although currently greater in length the spring semester hosts standardized testing SBAC AP testing These assessments while important compromise the actual number of days devoted solely to instructional delivery during the spring Balancing semesters for elementary schools is less of a concern as there is

school college prepared and career ready Whereas The middle grade years are a time of heightened vulnerability as the years between th and th grade are known for an increase in disciplinary problems motivational decline and initiation in risky behaviors Whereas Chronic absenteeism and behavioral problems in middle grades are clear warnings signals of leaving high school and without early intervention struggling middle school students will continue to leave school Whereas Los Angeles County has some of the largest middle schools in the nation with some grade sizes at least seven times larger in middle school than in elementary school These large environments can be intimidating for both students and parents and can impede learning Whereas In response to The Forgotten Middle report that described how critical it is for students to be on target for college and career the US Department of Education now recommends that students begin planning for college as early as th grade Whereas Middle grades education is the first step in the secondary to postsecondary pipeline and the last chance to get students on track for a high school curriculum that will make them college and career ready Whereas Students not adequately prepared in the middle grades for core high school subjects such as mathematics and English Language Arts can have difficulty catching up on collegereadiness requirements and Whereas The demand for workers with postsecondary education in California is projected to grow in the st century economy college and career planning needs to begin in the middle grades so that students are prepared for the rigorous curriculum of high schools now therefore be it Resolved That the creation of a collaborative team of parents students educators school leaders researchers District staff and other experts on the Middle Grades will work together to create a framework for collective action on reimagining the middle grades Resolved further That the

Proposition District staff first engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA District staff evaluated space at the District school sites andor in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School The Districts Educational Service Centers have been reorganized into Local Districts School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total in district classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs

prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgourprojectsschoolsiting Walking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school

Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow

focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points

students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for

where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small

progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was

that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas The District can make a complete and contiguous multisite offer to accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom

January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization

to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board

these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles

pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Pursuant to Proposition District staff first engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA District staff evaluated space at the District school sites andor in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School The Districts Educational Service Centers have been reorganized into Local Districts School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total in district classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for low income andor

Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report At the middle school level School setasides are used for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See

activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Id A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multi level correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications

of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education In the Districts overall API score increased by points to outpacing nearly all urban school districts in California Growth API LEA Report CA Department of Education API scores for students with disabilities improved by points and economically disadvantaged students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for

order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs

interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools

parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite

For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of

School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict

Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District

minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary

interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools

parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available

For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space

District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on

Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to

of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a

requested space in the same Local District as Charter School The Districts Educational Service Centers have been reorganized into Local Districts School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total in district classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement

Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active

walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API

Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates

changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of

tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to

possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh

have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a

Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary

system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools

parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgourprojectsschoolsiting Walking to school

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned

mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available

District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as

eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District

school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board

basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where

schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes

Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh

have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled

is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as

the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board

basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where

schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their

categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for low income andor students of color Cotton New Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore

Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgourprojectsschoolsiting Walking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Id A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multi level correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were

neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an overall API score of which was a point improvement over its score Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education Likewise in the District earned an overall API score of a gain of points which represented the largest increase among urban school districts in California Summary API LEA Report California Department of Education In the Districts overall API score increased by points to outpacing nearly all urban school districts in California Growth API LEA Report CA Department of Education API scores for students with disabilities improved by points and economically disadvantaged students improved by points Ibid Statewide however API scores dropped by point in Accountability Progress Reporting APR The statewide API target is for schools A total of District schools met or exceeded an API score in The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their academic success Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite

single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of

District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing

entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational

funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their

schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to

of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a

for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used

community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was

student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other

Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools

first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available

District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas

entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended

meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies

schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find

which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a

reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade

and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd

Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time

Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing

gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools

first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available

District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended

Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools

year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic

the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the

mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors

Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools

first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available

District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of

setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as

substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where

schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed

likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to

of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a

order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and

affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned

out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite

For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space

District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas

entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended

order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was

that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of

School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for

Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school co locations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schools withinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districts schoolbased health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education

their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School

Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time

Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools This would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area In the city of Chicago closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new non neighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and wellbeing In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities within Local District West PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts Charter Schools Division CSD determined that in the school year more than students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the previous school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools authorized by the District of any school district in the nation It had approximately times as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to legal andor safety requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating Charter Schools facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the Next Fiscal Year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the Next Fiscal Year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above setasides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the Next Fiscal Year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning in and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated Local District Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected inDistrict classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Here with the full implementation of the Plan it is projected there will not be space available for additional programs at Wright MS including sufficient space for WISH making it necessary to move WISH to multiple other District sites Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Based on an examination of

the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multisite offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever reasonably possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the Next Fiscal Year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all District students In doing so as

Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the Next Fiscal Year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the Next Fiscal Year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites andor the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Local District as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Submitted Revision Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District will seek to provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities within Local District West Whereas the number of District sites provided to Charter School will be minimized Whereas Because of the short distance between the District sites located within Local District West the facilities to be provided to Charter School will be contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas The District can make a

resolution in May directing the Superintendent to identify successful programs within the District including but not limited to magnets International Baccalaureate programs Dual Language Immersion programs STEMSTEAM programs and Pilot schools and develop a comprehensive strategy to grow these programs and strengthen instruction and support at neighborhood schools Whereas The Independent Financial Review Panel made similar recommendations for investment in successful District programs Whereas The Board serves as both the authorizer of the largest number of charter schools in the nation and is responsible for ensuring an excellent educational program for over students in LAUSD schools and programs Whereas Rather than incubating ideas and sharing best practices between robust LAUSD programs and innovative charter schools as originally envisioned recent tactics of saturation and strangulation threaten to create unnecessary competition for precious resources and to divides

Labors Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA states that butane poses health factors causing the following potential symptoms drowsiness narcosis asphyxia cardiac arrhythmia and frostbite from contact with liquid Whereas The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes butane as a colorless gas with gasolinelike or natural gas odor and lists butane as a chemical hazard that targets the central nervous system through exposure from inhalation andor contact with skin or eyes Whereas Butane is a gas that is typically shipped as a liquefied gas under its vapor pressure which makes it easily flammable and under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the container may rupture violently Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas In Petrolane developed the property located at N Gaffey St San Pedro CA into a storage facility for liquid petroleum gas which currently stores butane and small amounts of propane Whereas The Facility sits adjacent to the Palos Verdes earthquake fault which was not identified when the Facility was originally constructed Whereas In Rancho LPG Holdings LCC purchased Petrolane Whereas Rancho LPG stores butane and small amounts of propane at the Facility in two milliongallon refrigerated tanks and five gallon horizontal storage tanks Whereas The Facility is regulated by many local state and federal enforcement agencies including the US Environment Protection Agency EPA US Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration US Department of Homeland Security US Department of Transportation US Environment CalEPA California Emergency Management Agency California Department of Toxic Substances Control the South Coast Air Quality Management District the Los Angeles County Fire Department the City of Los Angeles Fire Department the Los Angeles Police Department and the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation Industrial Waste Management Division among several other agencies Whereas Federal State and local agencies have established regulations governing such facilities in the interest of protecting the public against excessive risk of injury illness or death whether the result of normal operations or by the occurrence of industrial accidents Whereas The operation of the Facility predates the more stringent healthprotective land use statutes enacted in recent years and it may be operating under conditional use permits that require periodic review to ensure the safety of continued operations Whereas Three LAUSD educational sites are in close proximity of the Facility including Taper Avenue Elementary School Johnston Community Day School and the Vic and Bonnie Christensen Science Center and Whereas The proximity of the Facility to the surrounding schools and community may pose a hazard in the case of a spill potentially causing a vapor fire pool fire and boiling liquid evaporative vapor explosion BLEVE now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of Los Angeles Unified School District hereby supports the efforts for the relocation of the Facility to an area where it does not pose any harm to students and their families Resolved further That the Board directs the Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel to work in collaboration with regulatory agencies to monitor and comment on any new requests for permits or modifications to any existing permits or landuse entitlements for the Facility and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolved That the Board directs the Superintendent to immediately submit this Resolution to the City officials as well as other Federal State and local agencies to request their support in relocating the Facility

Establishment of AllCharter Districts Waivers and Autonomies and Fiscal Impact Budget Facilities and Audit Committee January Presented By Megan K Reilly Chief Financial Officer Devora Navera Reed Associate General Counsel I Introduction Brief Overview of First Presentation Questions from the Committee What would be the net fiscal impact if we became an allcharter District What autonomies would the District gain What autonomies can be obtained through waivers Would the District continue to authorize independent charter schools Outline A Charter School Autonomies Independent Charter School Autonomies Corresponding Potential Fiscal Impact and Waivers Effect on Existing Charter School Authorization B Fiscal Analysis Economics of Charter vs Traditional District Finances General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to All Charter District A Charter School Autonomies The Mega Waiver The California Education Code provides that a charter school shall comply with the Charter Schools Act and all of the provisions set forth in its charter Otherwise charters are exempt from the laws governing school districts except Reporting and participation requirements for charter schools who choose to make STRS and PERS available to its employees Charter School Revolving Loan Fund requirements All laws establishing minimum age for public school attendance The California Building Standards Code What Mega Waiver Does Not Include The California Department of Education CDE lists the following examples of laws that charter schools must comply with State and federal constitutions and all federal laws All laws that are a condition of funding for any program that the charter school participates in The California Charter Schools Act Laws establishing minimum age for school attendance Laws governing nonclassroombased programs Educational Employees Relations Act Specific provisions of law related to teachers retirement and employee relations State pupil testing programs Criminal background check per Ed Code Comprehensive health screening and evaluation upon school entry What Mega Waiver Does Not Include Per LAUSD Policy on Charter Authorizing California Government Code sections conflict of interest applicable to public officers and employees Public Records Act Brown Act Political Reform Act School Climate Bill of Rights Chanda Smith Modified Consent Decree and SELPA Membership Crawford v Board of Education Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA Other Laws and Decrees McKinneyVento Homeless Assistance Act Constitutional due process for all students in implementation of discipline Ed Code Section d which prohibits a charter school from charging tuition and other fees integral to the provision of education Independent Charter School Autonomies Potential Fiscal Impact and Waivers Categories of Autonomies Instructional Operational Governance Fiscal Instructional Autonomy Fiscal Effect Waivers Curriculum including textbook adoption must meet Common Core State Standards Charter schools have to opt in to Williams compliance Potential additional costs to charters from selection of boutique publishers which may have higher per unit costs of instructional materials relative to districtwide purchasing Professional Development for differing textbook adoptions Williams If charter status Certain autonomous school models Expanded School Based Management Model [ESBMM] Pilot Schools Local Initiative Schools [LIS] and Affiliated Charter Schools have autonomy over curriculum PD per respective agreements and policy aligned with Common Core State Standards potential savings for not having to comply with the following Williams requirements Complete set of textbooks for all students in core subjects of math science ELAELD and social studies Hiring of qualified ie credentialed teachers Ensuring safe and decent school facilities Potential additional costs for professional development for delivery of instructional methodology Pilot Schools have most autonomy from central office curriculum requirements School Based Management Schools SBM may apply for waivers pursuant to BUL Same as above Instructional methodologies Instructional Continued Autonomy Course of Study Fiscal Effect Potential additional costs depending upon program design in the delivery of a broad course of study Waivers Same as above Assessments must at a minimum abide by California state assessments and testing Potential additional costs if charters select additional assessments above and beyond statewide tests Affiliated charter schools are required to meet or exceed the District standards and guidelines for implementing assessments Pilot Schools can opt out of Districtrequired assessments as long as their assessments are commensurate with District assessments in tracking student progress Instructional Continued Classroom Norm Ratios Potential additional costs or savings depending on class size ratio selected by the charter If lower class sizes selected it may also affect facilities costs Complex issue which requires more analysis and data on how charter schools are implementing norming and impact on their budget Autonomy Staffing Selection Evaluation Termination Flexibility over Duties of Staff Charter schools are waived from most employment provisions in the Education Code including tenure statutes teacher dismissal statues and LIFOlayoff statutes unless required by collective bargaining agreement Operational Fiscal Effect Waivers Potential costs for separate staffing infrastructure if charter chooses its own system of selection evaluation termination ESBMM and Affiliated Charters autonomy to select administrative certificated and classified staff subject to CBAs and District staffing policies and procedures Pilot Schools teachers sign elect to work agreements EWA which stipulates the work conditions for the school year autonomy to select Principal with LD Supt having final authority LIS have optionsMutual Consent teachers assignments staff appointments Operational Continued Autonomy Fiscal Effect Waivers Use of Third Party VendorsPublic Procurement Laws Potential costs or savings depending upon service utilized for third party vendors or procurement sought Charter sites would incur costs for creating system of selecting vendors [eg RFPs] Not waivable Public Contract Code section et seq and Government Code section governs procurement and professional services for public entities Bell Schedules Potential MO costs staffing ESBMM LIS and Affiliated Charters free to design and create bell schedules as long as it meets District requirements for minimum instructional minutes Pilot Schools freedom to modify school days and calendar years in accordance with their budget must meet state requirements for instructional minutes and days School Calendar must abide by minimum instructional minutes collective bargaining agreement Charter school year may be days rather than District requirement of days Potential MO costs staffing Same as above Operational Continued Autonomy Fiscal Effect Waivers Discipline Charters are waived from Education Code disciplinary provisions but must outline disciplinary procedures in charter Administrative credentials administrators do not need administrative credentials in charters Teacher credentials Charter schools have flexibility in identifying noncore and non college preparatory courses as long as it meets CA law requirement that English Math Science and Social Studies are core subjects Potential costs if charter chooses its own disciplinary procedures and creates its own system of enforcement Note Board of Educations School Climate Bill of Rights Potential savings if charters are able to hire administrators with less rigorous qualifications District policy has more stringent requirements minimum years of teaching experience Potential savings if charters are able to hire teachers with less rigorous qualifications Pilot Schools are waived from this District policy Charter schools have flexibility in identifying noncore and non college preparatory courses as long as it meets CA law requirement that English Math Science and Social Studies are core subjects LAUSD policy requires teachers to have EL certification Operational Continued Autonomy Private Site Facilities No Attendance Boundaries unless PSC charter or conversion charter Fiscal Effect Waivers Although possible unlikely LAUSD would look to a private site given its inventory of facilities Potential increase in revenue if students outside attendance boundary choose to attend new charter Affiliated charter schools are required to serve former attendance boundary Can serve students from outside attendance boundary and outside the District if there is capacity Note Public School Choice schools are required to serve attendance boundary Zone of Choice ZOC students who reside in a ZOC have the option to choose a school within the zone Governance Autonomy Fiscal Effect Nonprofit corporation governing board has autonomy over decision making None AllCharter District would continue to operate as a public entity School Site Councils are only necessary if charter school participates in a program or receives funding for a program requiring the development of a Single Plan for Student Achievement SPSA andor the development of School Site Council Potential savings if charter does not participate in the program does not receive funding pursuant to the SPSA Fiscal Autonomy Fiscal Effect Charter Schools exercise budgetary autonomy aligned with LCFF and the LCAP Potential costs for individual charter school sites to create their own LCAP Charter schools are capped at district unduplicated percentage that is used to calculate LCFF apportionments Charter schools operating as a nonprofit entity have broader ability to generate revenues Summary of Significant Autonomies Instructional Program Design Delivery of Course of Study Operational Staffing Flexibility over scheduling and school calendar Classroom Norm Governance Operated by a nonprofit corporation with generally localized decisionmaking Fiscal Broader ability to generate revenue Effect on Charter School Authorization To be Determined Upon Consultation with the State B Fiscal Analysis Economics of Charter vs Traditional District Finances Economics of Charter vs Traditional District Finances Revenues Local Control Funding Formula LCFF began in as the method of K school finance Simplified revenue system whose main variables are enrollment and demographics of needier students Model applies to both charter and traditional schools Charter schools are capped at the Districts unduplicated percentage that is used to calculate LCFF apportionments Economics of Charter vs Traditional District Financescontinued Expenditures Expenditure issues still remain outside of LCFF and are not addressed by statute or state policy Specifically the differences between charter and traditional schools are primarily in areas where funding does not differentiate based upon needs Special Education is an example of where significant expenditure disparities exist between charter schools and traditional schools but state revenue model is not based on need Economics of Charter v Traditional District FinancesContinued Special Education funding is based on a uniform rate per student without regard to severity of disability District schools serve a disproportionate share of severely disabled students than charter schools As a result the District bears disproportionately higher costs for students with disabilities than charter schools Economics of Charter v Traditional District Financescontinued Percent of students with severe disabilities Percent of Total Students Served LAUSD Charters in LAUSD Special Education Expenditures LAUSD General Fund student with disability Charters in LAUSD student with disability Ratio of Special Education spending between LAUSD and charters to Economics of Charter v Traditional District Financescontinued Other legacy costs impact districts but not charter schools Retiree health benefits and their bills not amortized over time If more students move to charters fixed and legacy costs will be supported by fewer resources Ultimately this creates a twotiered educational system with remaining students at District schools with higher fixed costs for Special Education and legacy costs General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to An AllCharter District General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District Caveats CDE has little or no financial guidance on converting to an allcharter district This is because LCFF law is silent and does not give CDE the authority to act on many of the fundamental issues required for conversion Lack of Precedent Only one multischool site district has converted to an allcharter district Kingsburg Elementary [Fresno County] sites with ADA as of Districtwide conversion occurred before LCFF law was enacted General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District The District may adopt one of two approaches in converting all schools to charter Convert all school sites to independent charter status Requires approval by District LACOE should the District deny the original petition State Board of Education should LACOE deny the appealed decision File two applications to the State for approval as an allcharter district One to the State Board of Education and One to the State Superintendent of Schools Both must separately approve the applications General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District Selected examples of issues that CDE is unable to address in allcharter district conversion Treatment of debt service General Fund contribution to Special Education Unfunded liability of retirement costs Collective bargaining costs Districtwide costs General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District State Board of Education SBE has oversight responsibilities over allcharter districts SBE would collect oversight fees from an allcharter district percent of revenue or approximately million for LAUSD The District must consider its role in monitoring autonomies at individual charter school sites Examples Provide technical assistance to school sites for instruction operation fiscal activities to improve success of charters District accountability requirements District interventions for failing charters or leave to the state General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District The Districts role in monitoring implementation of charter autonomies at schools will impact resources Providing technical assistance accountability andor intervention when needed will require resources Any resources applied to these activities could be partially offset by districtwide activities that are no longer required At this time cannot ascertain net cost or savings General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District Conversely individual charter school sites could consider what services they will undertake themselves versus what services they might request the District to provide centrally Examples would include staffing procurement scheduling and others Requests for the District to provide services might require the District to charge schools for those services General Fiscal Considerations in Converting to an AllCharter District Bottom Line District will be unable to convert to districtwide charter until CDE addresses fundamental fiscal issues involved in conversion Net fiscal impact of an allcharter district depends on how the District defines its role and how each individual charter school defines their role in the services and activities provided
