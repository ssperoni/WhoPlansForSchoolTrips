Board Fall Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Contents Letter from the Steering Committee Executive Summary Summary of Recommendations I Arts and Underserved Students II Arts at the Core of Education III Student Creativity IV Arts Across the Curriculum V Arts in a Global Perspective VI Professional Artists VII Affecting Policy at the National State and Local Levels VIII Building Partnerships Conclusion Centralizing Knowledge and Information References Appendixes A Letter from Arne Duncan U S Secretary of Education B Merging the Arts and History Sample Lesson Ideas C Draft Proposal An International Arts Exchange D NTFAE Meetings and Outreach E The National Task Force on the Arts in Education F Arts and Education Organizations Consulted Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century September Dear Colleagues It is our distinct pleasure to provide this report which represents nearly two years of work by the National Task Force on the Arts in Education NTFAE The College Boards Board of Trustees charged the task force to develop and articulate a vision for arts education in the United States with the hope that the College Board will use its considerable resources and influence to achieve and sustain an integrative vision for the arts in education Among the NTFAEs high priorities was the need to launch a major and newly focused conversation to develop strategies for making a profound and lasting impact on the role of the arts in education and ultimately the meaning of citizenship We believe the recommendations held herein will move us in the direction of success which will be fully realized when all K students have the opportunity to engage the arts in ways that draw upon their creativity and contribute to their lifelong learning Given the current state of affairs in regard to the arts in the nations schools and colleges seeking a complete understanding of their role in the education enterprise was a considerable challenge However through the diligent work of the NTFAE Steering Committee the assistance of regional and national arts education organizations and the support received from the College Board Office of Academic Initiatives we believe that the reports contents and recommendations have the potential to enrich the role of the arts in American education We are not alone in our concerns In a recent letter to school and education community leaders Secretary of Education Arne Duncan stated that In June we received the National Assessment of Educational Progress NAEP in the Arts results for music and visual arts I was reminded of the important role that arts education plays in providing American students with a wellrounded education The arts can help students become tenacious teamoriented problem solvers who are confident and able to think creatively These qualities can be especially important in improving learning among students from economically disadvantaged circumstances However recent NAEP results found that only percent of eighthgraders attended schools where music instruction was offered at least three or four times a week and only percent attended schools where visual arts were offered that often Secretary Duncan went on to emphasize that the federal governments role is intended to bring about a sea change in the ways students are exposed to the arts in the nations schools Given its highly regarded advocacy role in education the College Board has the opportunity to join this government effort and call for greater clarity regarding the vital role of the arts in student learning The work of the NTFAE has brought to the surface new information on the marginalization of the arts in K education Through a consultative process involving our arts education collaborators we learned even more about the need for broader quality arts education programs A vision for the way forward was derived from these interactive consultations Throughout the report you will note the urgent need to collaborate with other education and arts organizations on these complex issues The importance of the arts in the lives and future of our children and young adults is traditionally underestimated in American culture The NTFAE was formed with the intent to change that perception to one in which the arts play a significant role in a wellrounded and complete education for young people We believe the College Board can help our nation understand this concept The goal of the NTFAE was nothing less than to reenvision education in the United States We sought to articulate and incorporate a vision for the arts in our educational system a vision that includes providing professional development opportunities and empowering teachers and engaging greater numbers of professional artists in the field of education in the arts We also were acutely aware of the need to reach underserved populations and whenever and wherever possible to integrate the arts capacity for innovation enrichment and creativity with other disciplines so the arts become a natural part of the academic life of the students The NTFAE received major support and encouragement from many individuals and groups however we would like to offer special acknowledgments to College Board President Gaston Caperton Senior Vice President Lee Jones Vice President Dorothy Sexton and Director Nancy Rubino Were it not for their guidance and encouragement the success of this task force would not be realized Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Working in an environment of mutual respect and professionalism with the other arts stakeholders has been a rewarding experience for all involved Although the report is completed the work to enact the recommendations has only begun It is our collective hope that the NTFAE report will bring into sharper focus the critical issues affecting the arts in education and the need for the College Board and its member institutions to offer their muchneeded support for the furtherance of this vital and integral part of

Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Executive Summary Leading a New Direction in Education In addition to giving our children the science and math skills they need to compete in the new global context we should also encourage the ability to think creatively that comes from a meaningful arts education BarackObama com Throughout its long history the College Board has been a national leader in education and a steadfast advocate for equity access and excellence in education Thanks to its vision and professionalism state and national expectations have improved leading directly toward a strengthening of education throughout the United States particularly as it pertains to teaching assessment and college readiness However other factors have had an adverse effect on our schools Data from recent studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics among others show that our nations educational system is now in crisis and that our students knowledge and performance are lagging behind many other developed countries in every subject Without a change in course our schools are heading down a path that will leave our students inadequately prepared for stcentury society The NTFAE believes that the shortcomings of the educational system cannot be fixed by tweaking or patching but rather they require a systemic change We think that the current system which segregates subjects and types of learning splinters the effectiveness of learning by divorcing content from context and purpose Exclusion of the arts experience in schools means that students miss out on valuable cultural learning experiences as well as chances to develop their innovative thinking skills With the high school dropout rate growing higher each year we cannot afford to deny students the opportunity for increased academic engagement through arts learning In sharp contrast to our current system we propose a new curricular model with the arts at the core integrating many subjects and types of learning in order to give them context and meaning The NTFAE believes that our educational system needs a new paradigm and that the College Board must help lead the way The arts all the arts help students develop skills in group interaction selfesteem reflection decision making and innovative thinking With the arts at its core this new paradigm could provide a more effective learning environment that would induce the creative thinking needed for the stcentury global society and reinvigorate our youth and our teachers The NTFAE believes that the College Board can promote and utilize arts programming as an effective tool to improving education in general and as a solution to achieving access and equity for all students Studies consistently show that the arts are effective in keeping students in school engaging students in learning and promoting high achievement This is particularly true among lowincome and minority groups For example many disadvantaged students who might be struggling with their studies often find a connection with the arts Some students might find the physical activity required in music and dance more satisfying and more stimulating than reading at a desk or typing at a computer Work in the theater requires engagement and cooperation with others develops skills in language movement timing and organization and demonstrates the need for commitment and persistence and the great value of cooperation In the visual arts students learn decisionmaking skills innovative thinking the value and impact of content and many of the spatial and organizational skills taught in the other arts Studying the arts allows for more than a single right answer In the arts students explore analyze and discuss possibilities using different scenarios and critique the resulting interpretations As skillful educators have found teaching students to be creative is a deliberate process much like teaching students to be literate or to be able to solve mathematics problems It takes more than simply handing out materials expert teachers break down the creative process to enable students to identify the problem gather relevant information try out solutions and validate those that are effective Obstacles that prevent equity and access for all students and especially for those studying the arts must be removed Among these is the fact that many schools remove grades received in arts classes before calculating the grade point averages GPA of students seeking admission to college In addition arts courses are not required for graduation at many high schools even though the arts are identified as one of the core curriculum areas in the Elementary and Secondary Stuart Kerachsky NCES Statement on TIMSS Available at httpnces ed govwhatsnewcommissionerremarks__ asp Throughout this report we will refer to lowincome and minority groups as underserved students Learning in a Visual Age The Critical Importance of Visual Arts Education Reston Va National Art Education Association Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Education Act ESEA more commonly known as the No Child Left Behind Act The very clear implication is that since the arts are not required they certainly cannot be considered important This view of the arts prevails in our system and we believe that the College Board has a responsibility to take a leadership role in reversing it The arts are intrinsic to who we are as human beings and just as they have always been at the core of what we call civilization they should be at the core of the education we provide for our children In a letter August to school and education community leaders Secretary of Education Arne Duncan stressed the importance of the arts as a core academic subject and part of a complete education for all students and he noted how the arts play a significant role in childrens development and learning process The NTFAE urges the College Board to exercise its broad influence to encourage its members to implement and sustain quality programs for all K students in dance music theater and the visual arts One way in which the College Board could utilize its influence is to endorse a statement that stresses the importance of the arts and connects the arts to the role they play throughout our lives for the full development of Americans as human beings for the way the arts call attention to what human beings around the globe share in common and for advancing the College Boards commitment to equity and access Such a statement would position the College Board in the forefront of the Arts at the Core movement Ongoing research on the arts and cognition demonstrates a correlation between training in the arts and improved academic performance which emphasizes the importance of the arts as core disciplines and provides solid reasons for the College Board to become a strong advocate for the arts becoming an integral part of the core curriculum Arts at the Core should be supported by the College Board through its national and regional council structures and the NTFAE urges the creation of a Web page that can serve as a place to call attention to the statement mentioned above to promote College Board arts educational activities to provide links to other arts organizations and in general to promote the NTFAEs findings and recommendations The College Board can strengthen education by promoting creativity by recognizing achievement in the arts and by raising the visibility of the arts throughout its programs By recognizing and rewarding achievement in the arts at its national and regional forums the College Board can provide incentives for students teachers schools and districts to raise their levels of performance in the arts Presenting these awards at forums and conferences would demonstrate the College Boards support for the arts and enhance the quality of these events The awardees could be invited to speak on their involvement with the arts exhibit their artworks or perform their music or dance compositions Students paired with their teachers often make for compelling stories To set the bar high for the student artists professional artists should also be invited to be sponsors or guest artists The College Board has invested much into the arts primarily through its AP arts programs Studio Art Drawing D Design and D Design Art History and Music Theory and most recently through the appointment and funding of the National Task Force on the Arts in Education whose mission is to reenvision education in the United States with the arts at its core However this investment has low visibility and little presence in College Board publications and events If the College Board wishes to endorse reform of our national education curriculum through placing the arts at its very core then their support for and commitment to the arts must have a greater visibility and presence throughout all of its public events and publications We recommend that the organization include images of the arts in its pamphlets and brochures and ask speakers who represent the arts and performers in dance music and theater to participate in all College Board forums and conferences The NTFAE further believes the College Board must integrate the arts into its programs and services recognizing that infusing arts across the curriculum is an invaluable learning tool Creativity and imagination typically associated with the arts and which the arts encourage are critical to so many aspects of life in and out of school Study in the arts affects the way we learn and develops skills that will last a lifetime The arts themselves can teach thinking methods that result in more than one correct answer and they offer development of skills in perception handeye coordination decision making risk taking and innovative thinking They provide a cultural context that lends meaning to the study of other subjects For instance one can hardly study history geography and social studies without also studying the arts and cultures within the region of study By integrating the arts throughout other subject areas students can learn how music from an earlier era might have affected the social atmosphere and attitudes of the people who lived at that time Students studying history can learn a lot from the arts Using words alone is akin to presenting material in only two dimensions whereas the same words accompanied by paintings and music with students describing and analyzing what they are viewing transform the presentation into three dimensions Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century The NTFAE would like to see a more global perspective in both arts and nonarts programming within the College Board The rapidly changing demographic makeup of the United States and the advent of technologies that make it possible to communicate information over vast distances compel us to reassess our participation in a global society During these opening years of the st century mass media and the global span of technology allow us to sit in our homes and schools and easily observe and communicate with people in distant parts of the world Arts that derive from other world regions including folk traditional nonWestern or ethnographic art are often neglected or presented from a Western perspective that might not be true to its origin We feel that an authentic and enhanced global view of the arts would enrich students lives and promote global literacy The AP programs in Art History and Studio Art already embrace a more inclusive global perspective within their literature but more could be done to reinforce this outlook Other nonarts subjects could benefit by adopting a similarly global perspective on learning Additionally the College Board Schools could launch pilot programs that integrate global arts into nonarts courses thus serving as models for other programs In September at the inaugural NTFAE meeting the members of the steering committee stated that part of our mission would be to empower and educate arts teachers and to promote the engagement of professional artists and scholars in the fields of dance music theater and the visual arts in K education Many students are deprived of a quality arts education because schools cannot afford to or will not fund arts programming or hire teachers for the arts Often the arts are taught by classroom teachers whose expertise is in other subjects which is an unfair solution for both the students and the teacher Many factors contribute to the lack of arts programming in schools across our nation However asking nonarts teachers to teach the arts without providing them with the necessary professional development and education should not be the solution Instead arts education should be strengthened by requiring teachers to participate in the practice of their art and by providing them with practicebased professional development opportunities In addition professional artists should be given increased access to classrooms both through teaching artist programs and by loosening the constraints of teacher certification You will never recapture what the Persian Said in his language woven with birds and roses When in the sunset before the light disperses You wish to give words to unforgettable things Jorge Luis Borges Limits The NTFAE understands that the College Board does not make the rules regarding state certification of teachers However those who run the school systems do look to the College Board for guidance The NTFAE would like to see stronger criteria developed and published by the College Board that could guide high school programs on best practices focusing on professional development in specific arts disciplines and to provide model program curricula and effective methods for utilizing artists in the classroom This last item would include models of collaborative structures for artists to work with certified teachers Successful artsbased programs already exist in various parts of the country and the College Board should be a leader in this effort The College Board has grown a loyal membership through its effective programs and its leadership on national issues in education The NTFAE recommends that the College Board collaborate with member institutions policymakers education and arts communities and funders to promote policies that lead to effective practices and quality programs in the arts Teachers administrators and school superintendents look to the College Board for exemplary programming in most subject areas and for reliable effective tools for assessment teaching and professional development From this unique position it has the potential to send a strong message on how to improve education and enrich the lives of all students at all levels This message would signal to everyone that the College Board believes in the effectiveness of arts education and that it supports and promotes the necessity of placing arts programming at the core of curricula throughout all levels of the educational system The College Board can ensure the hope of a better education through the arts by making a strong position statement and by using its esteemed reputation to promote model curricula programs and best professional practices Through the College Boards regional structure colleges and universities should be encouraged to a include arts courses in college admission requirements and b include arts courses in GPA calculations By establishing criteria and identifying programs that can serve as models for curricula and methodology the College Board can steer this new paradigm for education into a new direction which is required of the stcentury student The College Board is one of many national state and local organizations that recognize the need for educational reform in the United States The NTFAE believes that the arts can play a central role in building a stronger reformed system and Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century over the course of our work we have begun to build relationships with many of our nations similarminded arts and education organizations Many of these organizations are already actively promoting the place of the arts in our nations educational system We encourage the College Board to lend its significant national reputation and political influence to this effort and to use these other organizations as resources for improving the arts programming of the College Board Therefore the NTFAE recommends that the College Board initiate and sustain alliances with arts and education organizations to develop collaborations that support the arts in K education Through its membership the College Board also has access to a large and diverse array of communities and campuses and we encourage the use of this network to promote the benefits of arts education as well as to locate and share information on community resources global artists and schools engaging in successful arts programming The need for educational reform in the United States is critical and no one organization can do it alone by working with similarminded organizations toward a mutual cause the College Board would be taking a significant step toward making educational reform a reality Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt Shakespeare Measure for Measure Additionally the College Board can provide national leadership by explaining and demonstrating to school superintendents principals state legislators and teachers as well as colleges and universities how to build a road to success by including the arts in curricular planning from elementary level through the college level Toward this end the NTFAE believes that the College Board could update its programs publications and website with inclusive language and useful information about the arts effect on learning Supportive research data could be presented and examples of model programs that are already finding success through the arts as well as videos that demonstrate effective arts teaching and interdisciplinary approaches that include the arts could be provided These videos could present more effective artscentered curricula as an alternative approach to the training that focuses on math and science which within our current educational system according to various research studies has failed our nations children We also believe the College Board can recommend uptodate research findings by major thinkers in this field including Daniel H Pinks A Whole New Mind Howard Gardners Multiple Intelligences Oliver Sackss Musicophilia Michael Gazzanigas Human The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique and Sir Ken Robinsons Out of Our Minds Learning to Be Creative We recommend that practical information be made available online in a userfriendly website that would serve as the central resource hub for instruction and information on field research The website should include Available field research data about the impact of the arts on learning college readiness and access and equity A data bank and resource guide that can be used to show teachers administrators and legislators the effectiveness and value of an arts education Videos of teachers who are using innovative teaching methods across disciplines to engage students Links to websites of organizational partners Examples of model artscentered curricula model programs lesson plans etc Chat rooms where students can connect with one another Seminar rooms where teachers can connect with one another The United States has lost its leadership position in the field of education in the industrialized world In science and mathematics and in graduation rates we have moved all in the span of three decades from the top of the list to somewhere near the middle with regard to providing more education for more of its young people as compared to all other developed nations and there does not appear to be a clear plan in place to offset this deterioration These recommendations of the National Task Force on the Arts in Education through the pervasive influence of the College Board can and must play a key role in the future of our youth and thereby in our country Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Summary of Recommendations Arts education in K schools colleges and universities is facing an escalating crisis which if not dealt with soon will deepen in both intensity and gravity It will continue to directly and adversely affect the quality of education available to our students and most important the wellbeing of the nation In order to reverse this trend and because the arts are a powerful way to both understand and shape the world the National Task Force on the Arts in Education recommends a set of short and longterm actions that will enable the College Board to take a leadership role in making the arts accessible to all students The NTFAE has identified these overarching recommendations to be followed by specific actions that will begin to resolve the issues identified by this task force Therefore the College Board will Promote Arts for Underserved Students Place Arts at the Core of Education Encourage Student Creativity Integrate Arts Across the Curriculum Utilize arts programming as an effective tool to improve education in general and as a solution to achieve access and equity for all students a Develop curriculum modules with the arts at the core to promote equity access and excellence in all schools and implement these modules in College Board Schools b Create professional development opportunities in the arts especially for teachers in lowincome and rural areas with

show the interrelationship between the arts and other disciplines b Infuse the arts into existing College Board curriculum development and professional development programs including College Board Schools CollegeEdMyRoad SpringBoard and AP nonarts subjects and in national and regional forum activities Using the Arts Academic Advisory Committee as a resource develop an arts curriculum for the College Board Schools that uses standards as a foundation and would serve as a model for a sound arts curriculum c Encourage AP SAT PSATNMSQT ReadiStep SpringBoard and CLEP test developers to create questions and prompts that reference the arts Establish a multidisciplinary College Board committee composed of the Arts Academic Advisory Committee chairs to examine the policies and the practices of these programs in order to explore and encourage ways in which nonarts subjects and exams might develop items that reference or include the arts Expand student potential by promoting creativity innovation and critical thinking skills recognizing achievement in the arts and raising the visibility of the arts throughout its programs and within its member K institutions a Establish a national award that demonstrates the critically important role of the arts in K education and that celebrates achievement in the arts b Integrate arts programming as well as the use of the arts across the curriculum into regional and national forums and conferences Suggestions include exhibiting student artworks inviting award recipients to present their work soliciting teachers from their region to come together for sessions that display and promote best practices adding professional or student and teacher performances to forum and conference programming and coordinating with other arts organizations to honor their award winners c Solicit a series of instructional modules in dance music theater and the visual arts from membership institutions and teachers These modules will be designed to stimulate students cognitive development and advance their intellectual and cultural understanding of the arts The Arts Academic Advisory Committee would review the submissions and determine those that would be published or featured on the Web page Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Summary of Recommendations Establish a Global Arts Perspective Support Professional Artists Affect Policy Build Partnerships Ensure that the global arts which include folk traditional and indigenous classical arts are integrated into its programs and services Promote the engagement of professional artists and scholars in the fields of dance music theater and the visual arts in K education a Launch a pilot program in College Board Schools to integrate global arts into both arts and nonarts courses a Encourage states to adopt alternative certification processes that enable arts professionals to teach in K classrooms b Endorse

college and university admission requirements in the arts including arts courses in GPA calculations working with regional accrediting agencies Wherever possible the arts should include the four major disciplines dance music theater and the visual arts c Advocate for the inclusion of the arts in major external and internal policymaking initiatives affecting K education Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century I Arts and Underserved Students When we think of American arts we may think of Duke Ellingtons Mood Indigo Jacob Lawrences The Migration of the Negro YoYo Ma the worldclass cellist who has a strong commitment not only to his music but to educational programs Gloria Estefan the founder of the Miami Sound Machine or Carlos Santanas Supernatural The arts have a long history of being an important part of the lives of underserved and multicultural students The history and performance of the arts have created educational opportunities for underserved students for decades Bernard Young Member NTFAE and Professor School of Art Arizona State University One of the greatest challenges for this nation is to ensure that achievement gaps in all areas of education among racial and ethnic minorities are eliminated This includes the improvement of the high school educational experience preparation and admission to colleges and graduation rates of students from lowincome backgrounds The National Task Force on the Arts in Education believes that greater access to arts education can serve as an effective tool in closing the achievement gap increasing the number of underserved students that achieve at the highest levels in education Learning through the arts provides an alternative for talented students who have difficulty assimilating information presented through more traditional academic modes verbal and mathematical Studies have indicated that students who have opportunities to participate and succeed in arts courses throughout elementary and middle school will be better prepared for advanced arts course work in high school This can result in increased enrollment in advanced course work across subject areas and by extension enable more students to attend college The arts benefit students in numerous ways including the development of decisionmaking skills and the ability to think creatively and innovatively An article published by the DANA foundation in May puts forth evidence that arts education promotes better overall academic achievement by increasing critical thinking and problemsolving skills The article cites Michael Posners research which concludes that if we are able to engage children in an art form for which their brain is prepared and they have an openness and creativity we can train them in this and see improvement in attention as well as intelligence and cognition in general Elizabeth Spelke a psychology professor at Harvard University also offers evidence that transfer occurs between arts learning and other subjects she found that children with moderate or intense music training showed small but reliable increases on abilities revolving around geometry Providing Equity Access and Excellence Through the Arts Opportunities in the arts are not equally available to all Numeric and anecdotal data suggest that underserved students often have fewer opportunities to participate in consistent highquality arts course work in middle school than their counterparts who attend schools with greater access to resources Reasons for this disparity include the fact that schools and districts with limited financial resources are often unwilling or unable to fund art programs at the middle school level In addition when arts courses are considered electives students who are identified as needing academic remediation will often have no time in their middle school schedule for arts course work because their elective class time is consumed by remedial courses During these lean economic times the arts curriculum is cut or reduced more often than not This only increases the achievement gap for underserved students The economy should not dictate who receives the many benefits that the arts can provide In order for the United States to be a competitive nation that reaches its full potential it must not permit financial or other barriers to prevent lowincome students from reaching their full potential When higher education is an achievable goal for all students regardless of income level our nation as a whole will benefit The NTFAE is interested in serving lowincome students as described by the CollegeKeys report but has expanded its concept of this population by including minority students and using the term underserved students in the arts to represent this group The College Board considers the following students to be low income Students enrolled in schools with large numbers of students from lowincome backgrounds or enrolled in schools with low collegegoing or high dropout rates This group would also include students whose families are eligible to receive economic subsidies targeted to lowincome families including students who are Eligible for free or reducedprice lunch programs Part of a family receiving public assistance Residents of federally subsidized housing It would further include students who are homeless in foster care or deemed to be wards of the court Also included are students who will be firstgeneration college attendees neither parent has a college degree and require some or all of the services needed by the students identified in the first three categories The CollegeKeys Compact Aalok Mehta Attention May Link Arts and Intelligence Available at httpwww dana orgnewsfeaturesdetail aspxid Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century The NTFAE believes that we can utilize the arts to address disparities in academic achievement among underserved groups Research has shown that participation in the arts can lead to increased attendance and decreased dropout rates among middle and high school students Studying diverse art forms and multicultural artists would increase equal educational opportunities for students from diverse racial ethnic gender religious social class and cultural groups and potentially increase academic engagement among these groups In their Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education James Banks and Cherry McGee Banks assert that these activities encourage students to acquire knowledge attitudes and skills needed to function effectively in a pluralistic democratic society and to interact negotiate and communicate with people from diverse groups According to Jerome Kagan art and music require the use of both schematic and procedural knowledge and therefore amplify a childs understanding of self and the world The NTFAE believes that the College Board is in a unique position to lead the way in providing access to a quality arts education for underserved students by integrating the arts into the curriculum at College Board Schools These schools can serve not only as testing grounds for artscentered programming but also as model programs If the College Board truly believes in the arts as part of the core curriculum its own schools should be following this model By studying and participating in diverse arts activities students will gain a muchneeded global literacy Such integration is particularly beneficial to student learning in literature history and language Maintaining Quality Instruction in Underserved Areas In the United States there are major funding and resource gaps between lowincome and highincome school districts In lowincome and poverty areas districts may not have the resources or the capacity to recruit or keep highly qualified teachers When teachers are underpaid or not given the resources they need to do their jobs well the burnout rate is understandably higher and these districts lose many of their best teachers to districts which can offer them an environment that helps them excel at their jobs This generally applies across the board in all academic subjects and it most certainly applies in the arts Unfortunately students in lowincome schools are among the students most in need of arts programs as access to the arts continually correlates with higher high school graduation rates among disadvantaged populations To help close the resource gap and maintain the best teachers in lowincome and rural areas professional development opportunities in the arts should be established for teachers in these areas Teachers of underserved students should be provided educational resources that enrich engage and support diverse learners as well as professional development programming that will help the teachers find resources and encourage them to continue their invaluable work in disadvantaged schools By targeting lowincome and rural areas the College Boards Professional Development Office can immediately affect the quality of teaching The Professional Development Office could utilize the Arts Academic Advisory Committee and the Test Development Committees for AP subjects in the arts as collaborators in identifying and developing programs for this purpose James Banks and Cherry McGee Banks

dana orgnewsfeaturesdetail aspxid Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Identifying Inequities To help underserved children learn in the arts it is necessary to understand how and under what circumstances they perform at exceptional levels Variations do exist in the learning opportunities and learning styles of underserved students and research is necessary to identify students learning differences in the arts Characteristics of optimal learning environments and opportunities should be researched so that clear recommendations can be made toward developing best practices We know that arts programming consistently correlates with increased academic success among underserved students and we also know that participation in AP arts programming is chronically low among underrepresented minorities Because AP arts programming should be equally available to students regardless of race and socioeconomic status and because AP arts programming could be of the most help to the students who are not enrolling the NTFAE recommends that the College Board research why this discrepancy consistently exists Some of this research should be available in the statistical data already collected by the College Board however additional specific data on what works well to close the equity and excellence gaps in the arts for underserved students are necessary Part of the College Boards stated mission is to connect all students to college success The NTFAE supports the College Board in this undertaking and through the following recommendations encourages the College Board to utilize the arts as a tool in promoting equity and access to education to all students Utilize arts programming as an effective tool to improve education in general and as a solution to achieve access and equity for all students a Develop curriculum modules with the arts at the core to promote equity access and excellence in all schools and implement these modules in College Board Schools b Create professional development opportunities in the arts especially for teachers in lowincome and rural areas with populations of underserved students c Research inequities in arts programming among underserved populations including a study on why participation in AP arts programs is chronically low among underrepresented minorities Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century II Arts at the Core of Education By combining a little imagination and historical and anthropological memory it would not be difficult to recognize that the arts are fundamental to our humanity In addition to the unearthed bones of early men and women there is ample evidence globally and especially on the walls of caves that art played an integral part in the lives of those first humans both as a means of communication and as expression It follows therefore that the arts are intrinsic to humanity and if they have been and are at the core of civilization they also need to be at the core of the education we provide our children As First Lady Michelle Obama has said with respect to the arts in America The arts are not just a nice thing to have they define who we are as a people The New York Times May College Board Endorses the Arts A statement from the College Board endorsing the importance of the arts would have the potential to attract the publics attention to what we along with President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan believe is a necessary component of educational reform in the st century The statement we would like to see written would connect the arts to the central role they play in creating educated Americans The arts promote essential skills for the stcentury world and workplace including imagination teamwork and creative problem solving They also remind us of our humanity and encourage us to appreciate beauty for its own sake and to value the pleasure and inner peace that the arts provide Equally important especially from the perspective of the College Boards mission is that the statement would call attention to the role the arts have played and the larger role they should play in contributing to equity and access A statement endorsing the arts in education would position the College Board in the forefront of the movement to reform education for stcentury learning and would lend this movement a greater legitimacy and broad public recognition Further with such a statement the College Board would function as a hub around which arts organizations school districts and the creators of curricula would be able to do their work more effectively with respect to moving the arts to their rightful place among other core subjects College Board Advocates Arts as Core Disciplines In the Dana Foundation funded a number of studies on arts and cognition in order to investigate correlations between arts training and improved academic performance Their report Learning Arts and the Brain published in calls attention for example to a Stanford University study on training in the arts reading and brain imaging in children correlations were found between musical training and reading fluency skills and between exposure to the visual arts and improved math calculation A study on arts education the brain and language conducted at the University of Toronto found that college students majoring in the performing arts had increased ability to generate new and novel ideas as compared to their nonperforming arts counterparts A second study on the same subject at Toronto found that individuals trained in dance were more accurate on additional tasks than nondancers and that individuals who received an early extensive and continued music education showed a greater ability to gain fluency in foreign language as adults The summary of the report which includes nine chapters and contributors all from major research universities includes the following conclusions An interest in a performing art leads to a high state of motivation that produces the sustained attention necessary to improve performance and the training attention that leads to improvement in other domains of cognition Genetic studies have begun to yield candidate genes that may help explain individual difference in interest in the arts Specific links exist between high levels of music training and the ability to manipulate information in both working and longterm memory these links extend beyond the domain of music training In children there appear to be specific links between the practice of music and skills in geometrical representation [] Correlations exist between music training and both reading acquisition and sequence learning [] Training in acting appears to lead to memory improvement through the learning of general skills for manipulating semantic information [] Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Adult selfreported interest in aesthetics is related to a temperamental factor of openness which in turn is influenced by dopaminerelated genes Learning to dance by effective observation is closely related to learning by physical practice [] Effective observational learning may transfer to other cognitive skills These findings point to the vital importance of the arts as core disciplines of education and to why the NTFAE believes it is imperative that the College Board advocate for the arts to be treated as such Not only will such advocacy be critical to those who will go on to professional careers in the arts and to our society at large that will forever benefit from our place in the audience but to all students whose education will surely profit from a new prominence given to the arts To quote First Lady Michelle Obama again I believe strongly that arts education is essential for building innovative thinkers who will be our nations leaders of tomorrow Supporting the Arts Regionally and Nationally Through its regional structure and extensive membership the College Board has access to schools and policymakers across the country The regional offices as well as regional and national forums can be utilized to promote the importance of the arts at the core Regional offices should communicate with their membership schools and institutions about best practices in arts education and forums should feature sessions and panels promoting the use of the arts in classrooms The College Boards scope and influence are unmatched among educational organizations in the United States and we encourage the College Board to use its breadth of influence to further the important cause of advancing the arts in education Additional recommendations for the presence of the arts at regional and national forums are included throughout this report The College Board can further communicate and publicize its support for the arts via a Web page dedicated to promoting the arts at the core of education The NTFAE recommends that such a Web page should include the proposed statement from the College Board endorsing the arts in education promotion of College Board arts educational programs and activities links to other arts organizations and their programs and studies and links to new and relevant publications that relate to the arts in education In short the proposed Arts at the Core Web page would serve as a hub to share and promote the task forces findings and recommendations communicate with the College Board membership and continue to build alliances with prominent educational and arts organizations and institutions Another benefit of this Web page would be to provide school districts with information and examples of current trends in arts education around the country and to encourage them to promote the arts in their own schools and communities This might eventually lead to greater consistency in state standards with regard to the arts and to colleges and universities being more receptive to including students artwork as an equal part of their admission considerations The Web page could also be a place where students and teachers could provide input and communicate more directly about the College Boards arts programming We urge the College Board to use its national influence to support the arts as part of a comprehensive stcentury education via the following recommendations Exercise its broad influence to encourage College Board members to implement and sustain quality programs for all K students in dance music theater and the visual arts a Publish a College Board statement that endorses the importance of the arts for all students in preK b Advocate for the arts as core disciplines in the curriculum The foundation established for student appreciation and understanding of the arts in K education not only leads to their future participation as audiences and consumers of the arts it also sets the course for those who excel and become the standardbearers in dance music theater and the visual arts c Support arts at the core of the curriculum through its national and regional council structures including forums regional activities and other conferences and create a Web page that provides information to member institutions on arts education programs and activities Carolyn Asbury and Barbara Rich eds Learning Arts and the Brain The Dana Consortium Report on Arts and Cognition New YorkWashington D C Dana Press vvi The conclusion of this report offers further discussion about the development of an Arts at the Core Web page Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century III Student Creativity Experiences in the arts have positive effects on students lives and should be a crucial component of every students education One of this task forces primary goals is to recommend ways to integrate the arts into the core of education so that they become a natural part of the academic life of students The arts can and should play a central role in American primary and secondary school education As stated earlier the arts promote creativity and innovative thinking and these skills can result in increased college success and over time a more enlightened public with regard to art and culture Valuing the Arts For decades arts programs have been among the first to be cut from school programs when budgets are tight These programs are often at a disadvantage when decisions are made to determine which programs will stay and which will be cut for the reasons highlighted throughout this document State assessment mechanisms do not include the arts the arts are not required for high school graduation arts grades are not included in GPA calculations for college entrance and arts programs can be expensive to operate and require different kinds of classrooms from those used for lectures Further for many administrators teachers and parents the arts were not part of their education and upbringing so they simply do not understand or value the arts The NTFAE believes that broad support for placing the arts at the core of education can be attained through the leadership of the College Board The organization has demonstrated support for the arts through its AP arts programming and more recently by supporting and funding the efforts of this National Task Force on the Arts in Education To follow up on these efforts we ask the College Board to continue its commitment to the arts in education by establishing a national award that demonstrates the critically important role of the arts in K education and that recognizes and honors achievements in the arts by students teachers and schools The College Boards existing recognition programs for teachers and schools exhibit its priorities and understanding of the value of exceptional teachers and schools However to date these awards have not recognized any arts teachers or artsfocused schools The NTFAE encourages the College Board to seek out an arts teacher or arts school for its existing awards and the organization can also demonstrate its commitment to the arts by creating an awards program for achievement in the arts Awards for students who are interested and accomplished in the arts could motivate students the same way the AP Exam does in other subjects Furthermore implementing awards and recognition programs in the arts will increase the visibility of the role of students and teachers in the arts and simultaneously emphasize the central place the arts should hold in the academic orbit The awards might be as simple as certificates of merit that students earn through a combination of any of the following teacher recommendations highquality achievement in local regional state and national events and test scores These certificates might be awarded regionally thereby enabling the College Board to reach more students The honored students could be invited to talk about their relationship to the arts at a regional conference of College Board members Students who receive recognition could also exhibit their artwork or perform dances monologues or music selections The awards and recognition should be considered in studentteacher pairs for when students excel there are always teachers behind them The regional vice presidents with advice from members of the Arts Academic Advisory Committee could create a plan of action part of which would be national in scope and part regional The leaders should ensure that local interests and strengths are reflected in the plans Additionally the NTFAE anticipates that other arts organizations will see the advantages associated with College Board leadership including high visibility and national exposure The partnership of other arts organizations will add breadth and depth to our effort to strengthen their experience in the arts for students in the American education system An oversight or clearance committee composed of arts educators educators in nonarts fields teaching artists and College Board administrators should be established to ensure that all recognition and awards for students teachers and programs include as their aim the advancement of education through the arts The national and regional offices of the College Board as well as national and regional forums should all play roles in the development and promotion of a national recognition program in the arts The NTFAE recognizes the financial implications of such a program and believes that developing regionalnational competitions with a partner or donor would decrease costs while increasing visibility for the College Board The Siemens Westinghouse Competition which awards student achievement in STEM disciplines might serve as a model for an arts award for exemplary students An arts award program will give tremendous visibility locally and nationally to the importance of teaching the arts Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century The Arts at College Board Events The NTFAE urges the College Board to spread the word that the arts are central to a broad enriched education This could be achieved in part by encouraging program coordinators for regional and national forums to promote sessions centered on the arts across the curriculum Such sessions would be beneficial to the College Boards membership while also serving the national interest Program committees could solicit teachers from their region to attend sessions that display and promote best practices and that demonstrate the many ways the arts benefit students both academically and personally The session presenters could share how they use the arts to teach their subjects including explanations of the advantages of integrating their subjects with the arts The presence of the arts in all its forms at College Board events would show the level of support for this endeavor In addition to sessions devoted to the arts in education members could view displays of artwork outside meeting rooms and workshops or sessions could begin with short performances by student musicians actors and dancers If students teachers and administrators see that we value their work in the arts their incentive to create and achieve will increase Sharing Best Practices The NTFAE recommends compiling a series of instructional modules across arts disciplines that are designed to stimulate students cognitive development and advance their intellectual and cultural understanding of the arts Many teachers and schools are already finding success in their arts programming and their successful lesson plans and curricular modules should be shared among CB member institutions Best practices could be collected and disseminated by the College Board the Arts Academic Advisory Committee could assist in soliciting and reviewing submissions of best practices and curriculum models and the most successful among these could be published or shared on a College Board Arts Web page Many success stories and model programs already exist and it is up to an organization such as the College Board which has the resources and the ability to share these pedagogical tools with the larger educational community Increasing visibility for successful arts programs as well as recognizing student achievement in the arts would give students and teachers the motivation to continue to pursue work in the arts In addition by recognizing students achievements in the arts the College Board would lend an educational validity to their studies promoting the idea that the arts should be a core component of education We ask the College Board to consider the following recommendations for increasing visibility for student achievement in the arts and for promoting student participation in the arts Expand student potential by promoting creativity innovation and critical thinking skills recognizing achievement in the arts and raising the visibility of the arts throughout its programs and within its member K institutions a Establish a national award that demonstrates the critically important role of the arts in K education and that celebrates achievement in the arts b Integrate arts programming as well as the use of the arts across the curriculum into regional and national forums and conferences Suggestions include exhibiting student artworks inviting award recipients to present their work soliciting teachers from their region to come together for sessions that display and promote best practices adding professional or student and teacher performances to forum and conference programming and coordinating with other arts organizations to honor their award winners c Solicit a series of instructional modules in dance music theater and the visual arts from membership institutions and teachers These modules will be designed to stimulate students cognitive development and advance their intellectual and cultural understanding of the arts The Arts Academic Advisory Committee would review the submissions and determine those that would be published or featured on the Web page In Appendix B we offer a few examples of how the arts can be used to improve teaching and learning across the curriculum to underline the assertion that the arts should be seen as core subjects For further examples of how the arts and history are merged successfully in the classroom see Robert Blackey To Illuminate History Making History Picture Perfect Teaching History A Journal of Methods Fall Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century IV Arts Across the Curriculum For decades academics have tended to treat their respective disciplines as separate entities complete in themselves disregarding the value that other disciplines might have in improving learning in their own subjects It is our belief that the encouragement of interdependence among disciplines and subject areas would benefit teachers students and ultimately society at large We also believe that the arts are especially well suited to interdisciplinary learning and that the arts have the potential to strengthen learning abilities across subject areas In fact there is a growing body of research that suggests that training students in the arts may change the structure of their brains and the way they think After all creativity and imagination typically associated with the arts and which the arts encourage are critical to many aspects of life in and out of school According to the Conference Board there is an overwhelming consensus from superintendents percent and corporate leaders percent that [c]reativity is of increasing importance to the U S workforce Of those corporate respondents looking for creative people percent said they were having difficulty finding qualified applicants with the creative characteristics they desired The New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce in its report Tough Choices or Tough Times states that ours is a world in which comfort with ideas and abstractions is the passport to a good job in which creativity and innovation are the key to the good life A Lake Research poll of likely voters revealed that percent of voters believe that a greater focus on the arts alongside science technology and math would better prepare students to address the demands of the st century Utilizing the arts as a pedagogical tool to teach other disciplines provides more students with the chance to excel at academics by offering an alternative way for them to learn and process information We encourage the College Board to recognize the value of the arts as teaching tools for interdisciplinary learning in addition to being distinct subjects in themselves Vertical Team Revitalization Vertical teaming helps subject teachers connect across grade levels to ensure that they are providing the fundamental concepts and skills that their students will need to be successful in AP courses The current AP Vertical Teams guides were produced in and need to be updated to include an introduction that contextualizes the guides and discusses the importance of the arts in education Since the most recent publication of the AP Vertical Teams Guide for Fine Arts there have been significant changes in AP Music Theory and AP Studio Art most notably the creation of a new Course Description the transition from slide to digital portfolio submissions and revisions to the portfolio scoring guidelines Additionally the AP Art History course is not included in the current AP Vertical Teams Guide for Fine Arts An improved updated version of this guide is needed one that incorporates all three AP arts course offerings and that contains accurate current information about the curricula of these AP courses Since many middle school arts courses include offerings in theater and dance it would be valuable to include consideration of these disciplines within a new AP Vertical Teams Guide for Fine Arts Although the AP Program does not currently offer course work in theater and dance the learning achievement of middle school students within these artistic disciplines can certainly be successfully applied to augment their understanding of music and the visual arts as there are significant commonalities within these artistic disciplines An updated AP Vertical Teams Guide for Fine Arts that is interdisciplinary across the arts would increase potential benefits of vertical teaming to students and teachers and would help enrich the knowledge base of students who participate in AP arts courses Vertical teaming is important in promoting another College Board goal equity Updating the existing Vertical Team guide and ensuring that it is distributed to lowincome schools could work as an effective strategy toward achieving equity in education As stated earlier studies consistently show that underserved students often have fewer opportunities to participate in consistent highquality arts course work in middle school than their counterparts who attend schools with more resources Poor schools and districts may be unwilling to fund art programs at the middle school level students who are identified as needing academic remediation may have no time in their middle school schedule for arts course work Wider implementation of the AP Vertical Teams Guide for Fine Arts could result in more schools and districts understanding Getting Scientific About Arts Education Los Angeles Times May A One researcher studying students who go to an arts high school found a correlation between those who were trained in music and their ability to do geometry Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century that students success in arts classes like that of all other academic disciplines is dependent upon establishing a solid foundation of knowledge In addition consistently maintaining quality arts programs at the middle school level is essential in order to provide opportunities for student success in the arts in high school and college This wider implementation could be accomplished through increased promotion of the Vertical Teams concept and increased professional development to support Vertical Teams Interestingly the current NAEP Nations Report Card indicates that disparities in achievement of minority and economically disadvantaged students compared to white and economically advantaged students are significantly less in visual art than in math and reading An analysis of this data might prove valuable as it pertains to the role the arts might play in providing learning opportunities for underserved students Integrating the Arts into College Board Curriculum and Professional Development Programs The NTFAE recommends that the College Board infuse the arts into its existing curriculum development programs and its college readiness products By integrating the arts into its programming the College Board would not only exemplify its commitment to the arts but would also grant students greater access to an arts education that could positively affect their academic performance across subjects their college readiness and their options for higher education As we have pointed out earlier in this report the College Board Schools offer the College Board a unique opportunity to lead the way in providing access to a quality arts education for underserved students In addition to integrating the arts across the College Board Schools curriculum the NTFAE believes that the College Board should take the opportunity to develop and introduce a curriculum for arts education as a distinct subject in College Board Schools Using the Arts Academic Advisory Committee as a resource and their standards as its foundation this curriculum could then serve as a model arts curriculum for College Board member institutions In addition the NTFAE recommends that the arts be made visible in the College Boards college readiness products and educational initiatives Because the arts are so often cut from a schools programming or made optional in the form of extracurricular classes students are less likely to view them as serious subjects that can be pursued in higher education or that can lead to a lucrative career Including information on the arts in programs such as CollegeEd and MyRoad would help reverse this view of the arts and expand the body of students who find options and opportunities in the arts CollegeEd and MyRoad could provide examples of careers in the arts and help students learn how to track an academic course toward achievement in the arts or artsrelated fields Showing students and their families that the arts can be pursued beyond high school could provide an entry point into college for those students who are not as successful in traditional academic modes but who excel in the arts Shelley Keiper Brent Sandene et al The Nations Report Card The National Center for Education Statistics June Available at httpnces ed govpubsearchpubsinfo asppubid Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Integrating the Arts into Existing College Board Assessment Programs The College Board and the arts are at a crossroads An opportunity exists for the College Board to make a difference with regard to the arts just as it did with the addition of a writing section to the SAT The addition of a writing component to college entrance testing has called attention to the need to teach writing at all levels of education It follows that if the PSATNMSQT AP CLEP and other College Board assessment programs integrate the arts into the existing guidelines for composing questions making it clear that there is value to integrating the arts across the curriculum it would surely have a trickledown effect on education at the elementary and middle school levels It is widely known that the No Child Left Behind legislation has resulted in public schools being pressured to focus on math and reading As a result considerably less emphasis is being placed on other subjects and in many cases the arts have been eliminated altogether It has become a necessity therefore for the arts to be infused across the curriculum which may be the only way some children will have access to them This does not mean that we are advocating the elimination of separate arts courses and programs on the contrary we strongly believe standalone courses in the arts are vital to a wellrounded education The recommendations below offer ways in which the College Board can play a role in integrating the arts into nonarts courses Integrate the arts into its programs and services recognizing that infusing arts across the curriculum is an invaluable learning tool a Update the AP Vertical Teams guides beginning with those under development and proceeding to those in the arts and other subjects and make them available to all schools Using the Arts Academic Advisory Committee as a resource update the guides to be more inclusive of nontraditional modes of learning and to show the interrelationship between the arts and other disciplines b Infuse the arts into existing College Board curriculum development and professional development programs including College Board Schools CollegeEdMyRoad SpringBoard and AP nonarts subjects and into national and regional forum activities Using the Arts Academic Advisory Committee as a resource develop an arts curriculum for the College Board Schools that uses standards as a foundation and would serve as a model for a sound arts curriculum c Encourage AP SAT PSATNMSQT ReadiStep SpringBoard and CLEP test developers to create questions and prompts that reference the arts Establish a multidisciplinary College Board committee comprised of the Arts Academic Advisory Committee chairs to examine the policies and the practices of these programs in order to explore and encourage ways in which nonarts areas and exam subjects might develop items that reference or include the arts Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century V Arts in a Global Perspective The rapidly changing demographic makeup of the United States and the advent of technologies that make it possible to communicate information over vast distances compel us to reassess our participation in a global society During these opening years of the st century mass media and the global span of technology allow us to sit in our homes and schools and easily observe and communicate with people in distant parts of the world In a matter of hours international travel can place us in the far reaches of the planet Immigration is bringing new populations into our schools and colleges The NTFAE believes that as a nation and as a people we cannot consider ourselves apart from the incredible explosion of global diversity and the crucial philosophical issues that underlie the current challenges brought about by the transforming measures of globalization Within the context of these social technological economic and educational changes we should realize that the arts are now experiencing greater marginalization in American schools than nearly a half century ago PreK educators cite many presentday reasons to account for the arts moving from a curricular core to the periphery including block scheduling funding cuts program reductions reduction in standards of teacher training and greater emphasis on writing and the STEM disciplines science technology engineering and math As arts practitioners and scholars we know that the arts in human culture are as pervasive as language They are not only a conveyor of human thought and experience they provide an understanding of human creativity and innovation on a global scale Issues surrounding aesthetics diversity identity race and ethnicity are at the heart of global arts learning opportunities The NTFAE defines global art as the folk traditional and indigenous classical arts outside of the tradition of Western classical tradition it is the creative expression by human communities throughout the world that is articulated through many expressive disciplines including music the visual arts dance and drama As the United States becomes more diverse and our participation in a global economy becomes a national imperative the NTFAE encourages schools colleges and universities to provide the means for students to experience and gain an understanding of and an appreciation for the arts on a global scale The NTFAE has observed that teaching and learning of the global arts are being further marginalized if not removed altogether from the core of our educational systems Our research reveals that in the vast majority of U S schools European derived arts form the foundation for arts education We need not be apologetic about the pervasiveness and significance of Europeanderived arts nor should we position global arts to be in competition with them We also should not question the necessity to expand students knowledge of the STEM disciplines The NTFAE believes that the future of our nation requires our students to be active participants in a global community and we should educate them to understand and appreciate the arts in a broader global context Unfortunately global arts are rarely or are minimally included in the offerings of existing arts programs Changing demographics globalization and the need for global learning would seem to encourage changes in this area Increasingly educators espouse the fact that our students will live in an ever more global environment Therefore the NTFAE advises the use of every means available to us including global arts to expose students to the peoples and cultures of the world Integrating Global Arts One way to encourage global arts in schools is to ensure that they are seen to be inclusionary a part of the total learning experience Therefore the NTFAE recommends integrating a global arts perspective in its programs and services The task force recommends that the College Board launch a pilot program in College Board Schools to integrate global arts into both arts and nonarts courses Such integration would be particularly beneficial to student learning in literature history and language courses By studying and participating in global arts activities students would gain a muchneeded global literacy Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Global Arts and Professional Development Additionally the NTFAE recommends using existing College Board professional development workshops and seminars for teachers to advocate for the infusion of global arts into all arts courses Many music art and drama courses in our schools are devoid of any reference to similar genres in world cultures The College Board should start by encouraging the integration of global arts into existing Advanced Placement courses including AP Music Theory and Art Studio Moreover we encourage the College Board to take an active role in encouraging schools to integrate global arts into all of its arts courses Promoting CrossCultural Exchanges Finally Internet social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace offer free easy access for students to learn what other students and artists in other parts of the globe are doing The NTFAE therefore recommends establishing a Webbased network for student and teacher virtual exchanges to promote crosscultural education and artistic inspiration in dance music theater and the visual arts of diverse cultures from around the world Guided by the College Boards motto of inspiring minds the NTFAE believes that we should advocate for the development of programs and services that will allow our students to apply their innovative and analytical thinking skills to comprehend the value of global arts Therefore we recommend that the College Board do the following Ensure that the global arts which include folk traditional and indigenous classical arts are integrated into its programs and services a Launch a pilot program in College Board Schools to integrate global arts into both arts and nonarts courses b Advocate for the infusion of global arts into all arts course offerings using existing College Board professional development workshops and seminars for teachers c Establish a Webbased network for studenttostudent and artisttoteacher virtual exchanges to promote crosscultural education and artistic inspiration in dance music theater and the visual arts of diverse cultures around the globe Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century VI Professional Artists Among the set of goals articulated at the first NTFAE meeting in September were the objectives of engaging a greater number of professional artists in the field of education in the arts and empowering and educating our existing arts teachers Engaging professional artists in the classroom is a way to model the importance of the arts and demonstrate career possibilities in the arts to students Therefore one of the aims of the NTFAE is to recommend ways that the College Board can actively involve professional artists in its arts programs advocate for using teaching artists in classrooms and provide practicebased professional development for arts teachers We accept the dual premise that comprehension of the content of the arts and traditional teaching skills are equally necessary for teaching the arts However we are concerned that professional development for K arts teachers does not always encourage a proficiency and currency in the specific art being taught College and university arts teachers believe it is minimally necessary to be proficient in both areas and they are required to be active exhibitors or in the case of performing artists active performers The NTFAE believes that this emphasis on proficiency and activity in the field is a model that could be useful for K arts educators as well Encourage Alternative Certification Processes As public education is now generally constituted across the nation teacher certification policies often preclude professional artists from offering their unique skills perspectives and insights to public school classrooms The problem is twofold often teachers whose proficiency and expertise lie in other areas are assigned to teach the arts while artists who have the knowledge and experience necessary to provide students with an exceptional arts education are not permitted to do so because they do not have teacher certification To further illustrate this disparity we offer the following excerpt from a speech given by Leonard Lehrer chair of the NTFAE when we met with the full task force in September of Suppose Colin Powell tires of giving apop speeches and wants to teach high school social studies Suppose Meryl Streep has a hankering to teach drama Alas they would be unqualified for a public school Elite private schools would snap them up of course but public schools that are begging for teachers would have to turn them away because they dont have teacher certification As The Teaching Commission and the Brookings Institution state Confusing and cumbersome procedures discourage many talented wouldbe teachers from entering the classroom And [r]ather than dig further down in the pool of those willing to consider teacher certification programs or raise class sizes we need to expand the pool of those eligible to teach Colin Powell Meryl Streep and many anonymous others would dazzle the surliest student so why continue to bar them from the schoolhouse door When certification becomes an impediment to the students access to a meaningful experience in the arts solutions must be found to remedy the situation The solution like the problem is twofold strengthen arts education by requiring better practice and professional development in the subject areas and loosen the constraints of teacher certification In addition to teaching the technical processes of the arts arts education must focus on intent content and subject As such there is a genuine need to provide arts teachers with professional development that emphasizes an understanding of the art in question and that encourages professional engagement in the content area Further alternative certification programs that recognize mastery of an arts discipline as a qualification for teacher certification would be a way to broaden the pool of professional artists in the classroom thereby providing more students with a quality arts education Endorse Collaborative Instructional Models Many schools and community organizations currently form partnerships to bring professional artists into classrooms Teaching artists programs pair professional artists with certified classroom teachers to bring the arts into classrooms both as distinct subjects and as tools to teach crosscurricular subjects Many of these programs have proven to be hugely successful in improving attendance rates and academic performance in students Such programs should be researched and recognized as model programs for the arts in education Develop and Disseminate Best Practices Best practices in the arts including those that employ professional artists in the classroom should be collected and disseminated via the College Boards Connection and its Web page Publishing examples of best practices can help general education teachers gain the tools and knowledge to use the arts in their teaching as well as empower them to find teaching Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century artist programs that would supplement their lessons by bringing professional artists into the classroom In addition offering these materials online would benefit teachers who do not have the funding from their districts or the time to create their own teaching materials and these materials would serve as supplements for those teachers who do We urge the College Board Trustees following their discussions of this report to authorize the creation of a group to be coordinated with the Arts Academic Advisory Committee to research and endorse programs that successfully address these issues and that allow for the pairing of those teaching the arts with professional artists The College Board can work to bridge the gap between the public education establishment and professional artists so that professional artists are recognized as valuable resources to be utilized for the educational improvement and wellbeing of all students Below are recommendations for specific ways in which the College Board can play a significant and influential national role in improving arts education through the engagement of professional artists in the classroom Promote the engagement of professional artists and scholars in the fields of dance music theater and the visual arts in K education a Encourage states to adopt alternative certification processes that enable arts professionals to teach in K classrooms b Endorse instructional models that employ practicing artists in collaboration with certified teachers c Develop a set of best practices for professional artists regarding instructional approaches and strategies for teaching and learning in todays classrooms Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century VII Affecting Policy at the National State and Local Levels While Barack Obama was running for president of the United States an Obama arts policy website was developed to explain his policy platform in support of the arts He is quoted as saying I want our students learning art and music and science and poetry all the things that make an education worthwhile Barack Obama February The Obama arts policy platform advocates that as a country we [r]einvest in arts education To remain competitive in the global economy America needs to reinvigorate the kind of creativity and innovation that has made this country great To do so we must nourish our childrens creative skills The College Board website states that the College Board is actively involved in influencing education policy in nearly all of the states As a result of relationships with key policymakers in many state capitals the College Board works to support new state policies and initiatives that connect all students to college success The College Board is currently involved in affecting education policy through its office in Washington D C and through a variety of policy initiatives including an effort to increase the number of Americans receiving a postsecondary degree by and improving the schooltocollege transition In efforts to reach these goals the College Board provides technical assistance to the states as they seek to Raise academic standards Increase course rigor Promote educational equity Increase teacher and counselor professional development opportunities Promote strong PreK alliances The NTFAE believes that the College Board could further these stated goals by increased engagement with and support for the arts As stated throughout this report rigorous study of the arts promotes creativity and innovative thinking helps develop character and promotes responsibility and leadership all are qualities that will be needed to meet the demands of a stcentury education Learning through the arts can provide an alternative for talented students who underperform in learning environments that emphasize verbal and math skills Research shows that participation in the arts can improve attendance and reduce dropout rates by engaging students in activities that promote community interaction The College Board can give voice to the importance of a thorough education that includes the arts by affecting policy building alliances and advocating directly at the national state and local levels Policy Challenges The arts face many obstacles that not only keep them from serving as effective contributors to our childrens education but also threaten to diminish or eliminate the arts from education altogether One of these obstacles is the most prominent education policy at the national level the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ESEA commonly known as No Child Left Behind This federal legislation affects every public school student in the United States ESEA Title IX Part A Section D defines the core academic subjects as English reading or language arts mathematics science foreign languages civics and government economics arts history and geography Although the arts are included in the definition of these core academic subject areas the enormous testing requirements that have been assigned to reading math and science have left little room for the arts Because the states have not supported assessment in the arts equal to these other subjects the arts have actually lost ground in the curriculum In a study the Center for Education Policy found that since the enactment of No Child Left Behind percent of school districts with at least one school identified as needing improvement have decreased instruction time in the arts This reduction translates to diminished access to the arts leaving many students without the full benefits of an arts education Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Given the demonstrated potential for the College Board to inform policy decisions the NTFAE recommends that the College Board use its voice and political influence to help shape reauthorization of ESEA as it pertains to intended learning outcomes affected by curricula assessment funding and teacher professional development in arts education The College Boards endorsement of the arts as a core component of primary and secondary education would deliver a strong message to administrators and legislators who make budgetary decisions on curriculum and support No other organization has the farreaching influence on American education that the College Board enjoys At this critical time in our nations history the arts need this powerful voice if they are to survive the downsizings and bankruptcies of our schools and our culture More significantly our children need the arts to obtain a complete education to succeed in their careers and to experience a rich meaningful life Identifying and Defeating Impediments The NTFAE believes that methods for artsbased learning are inconsistent Impediments that prevent opportunity and access to arts education include school districts nationwide that do not require arts courses for high school graduation college admittance processes that include a recalculation of students GPAs with arts courses omitted and major discrepancies among the states standards for the arts To help defeat these impediments higher education institutions should be encouraged to a include arts courses in college admission requirements and b include arts courses in GPA calculations If higher education institutions demonstrate that arts are valued in these ways high schools across the nation will be motivated to put more emphasis on course work in the arts The Academic Assembly Council could help launch this move through a series of talking points at the regional forums via specific sessions and at workshops aimed at and attended by administrators and policymakers The inclusion of arts courses in GPA calculations identifies them as distinct subjects and raises the level of the arts to that of other traditional academic subjects that tend to be given higher priority especially when it comes to state and national testing Providing Leadership in PolicyMaking Initiatives Affecting K Arts Education Reforming education in and through the arts will require significant advocacy by a broad constituency with maximum credibility The College Board and its member organizations are positioned to advocate at the policymaking level for placing the arts at the core of education by including the arts in initiatives related to college readiness teacher professional development and curriculum design Additionally the College Board could brief legislators in regard to the release of the National Task Force on the Arts in Education report to increase awareness of how students benefit from an education with the arts at the core Key legislators members of the Congressional Arts Caucus collaborating organizations and educators could join College Board leaders and members of the task force for the briefing possibly on a date to coincide with Arts Advocacy Day which is sponsored by Americans for the Arts The College Board should survey its internal and external education advocacy strategies for how they can influence arts education policies and promote the arts in education in the context of the vision set forth in this report The following recommendations offer specific strategies for how the College Board can move forward in this effort Collaborate with member institutions policymakers education and arts communities and funders to promote policies that lead to effective practices and quality programs in the arts a Use the College Boards advocacy resources to help shape reauthorization of ESEA as it pertains to learning outcomes in the arts such as curriculum assessment teacher professional development and funding for the arts in education b Provide leadership on arts requirements for high school core curricula high school graduation requirements and college and university admission requirements in the arts including arts courses in GPA calculations working with regional accrediting agencies Wherever possible the arts should include the four major disciplines dance music theater and the visual arts c Advocate for the inclusion of the arts in major external and internal policymaking initiatives affecting K education Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century VIII Building Partnerships In fall the national leaders in the arts and education who make up the NTFAE met in New York City to discuss the state of education and the role the arts can play in building a stronger reformed system The NTFAE steering committee also invited more than representatives of national organizations for a followup meeting in January in Charleston S C Some of the represented organizations were Americans for the Arts International Council of Fine Arts Deans National Art Education Association Council of Chief State School Officers College Music Society and National Office for Arts Accreditation As a result of these and other significant meetings and discussions over the past two years the NTFAE has made substantial progress in enlisting the cooperation of many leaders of these national and state education and arts organizations who are willing to partner with the College Board on this important mission In fact these leaders have already begun activities within their own organizations to further our mutual cause and they are awaiting reciprocal action from our task force and the College Board Our hope is that existing College Board offices committees and programs including the Office of Academic Initiatives and the Arts Academic Advisory Committee will adopt policies to expand and solidify connections with these organizations that share our interests and goals so that in the future we can continue to work toward positive collaborative efforts On this point we agree The need for education reform is dire but the scope is so far reaching that no organization can do the work alone Many national state and local organizations have been heavily involved in arts education for decades The College Board as a partner in this effort has the membership and national influence to magnify the effects of this movement Provide Information and Promote Community Partnerships Because of the growing tension between federal and local governance regarding education reform it has become increasingly important to facilitate communitybased advocacy Affecting policy decisions related to the underserved populations wherever they exist could best be accomplished by working through the College Boards member institutions Given its vast institutional membership network which touches nearly every community the College Board is positioned to share information through this infrastructure to inform arts education advocacy at the community level The NTFAE dedicated a significant component of this report to articulating the benefits of providing arts experiences for underserved populations Member institutions partnering directly with communitybased organizations in underserved areas are the most efficient means to promote quality arts education for this constituency In addition the College Board should make a special effort to include sessions at its annual and regional meetings that showcase effective member institutioncommunity partnerships These panels should address issues that pertain to ways of providing arts experiences and arts education to underserved populations Build Partnerships Share Resources and Change Policy Goals in Arts Education Substantive education reform will require sustained alliances with a broad constituency Some states are beginning to study and implement new stcentury learning goals that span many subject areas in order to prepare students for success in the future The Arts Education Partnership AEP has identified states with stcentury learning initiatives These initiatives generally focus on the need for greater emphasis on creativity innovation communication collaboration and technology for a thorough education Partnering with the AEP would provide an opportunity for the College Board to work with those states interested in developing similar initiatives As stated throughout this report the NTFAE believes that placing the arts at the core of learning is a key component of education reform in the st century A number of credible national organizations have a long history of working to improve the quality of arts education in efforts to move the arts to the core of education This existing infrastructure spearheaded by organizations such as the Arts Education Partnership and Americans for the Arts provides opportunities for the College Board to collaborate The NTFAE suggests that the policyadvocacy staffs of the College Board Americans for the Arts and AEP set up meetings to discuss how through an alliance between these organizations a shared national agenda could be forged and what vehicles might be created for implementing the task forces recommendations These organizations along with other arts education professional organizations will be stronger if they share resources research and venues to advocate for quality arts education programs throughout the United States Many of the arts and education organizations in the U S are represented on the task force andor have provided significant input in this report Several task force members currently serve in leadership positions in these organizations and have Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century found ways to make important connections These alliances would be strengthened if the College Board used its influence and resources to become a full partner in advocating for all students to have access to highquality arts programs as part of their K education Promote Alliances with Global Artists Earlier in this report we explained the need for the College Board to integrate global arts into arts and nonarts courses to promote global arts in professional development workshops and seminars and to develop crosscultural exchanges via the Internet However arts that derive from other world regions including folk traditional nonWestern or ethnographic are often neglected or given short shrift in our schools because it is often assumed that teachers are not trained to provide these specialized studies However the NTFAE believes that the resources which are clearly present in our midst are not being fully utilized For example global artists who live in our communities are not being called to introduce their many processes of creativity that contribute to the cultural world The NTFAE believes that an effective way of integrating global arts in stcentury learning is to incorporate locally based global artists into our schools Locally based global artists can provide firsthand experiences on the creative processes from around the world while highlighting the need for preserving world heritages and stimulating cultural vitality and diversity in K education The concept of visiting artist or artistinresidence has long been a title of distinction in colleges universities conservatories and museums In these instances these artists expose students to trends and styles in the arts to which they are only rarely exposed during the normal course of instruction The NTFAE proposes that the College Board apply the same concept on a broader level to take advantage of the rich resources global artists can bring to classrooms and studios Who are these global artists and where do we find them Global artists reside in communities throughout the nation they are dancers musicians designers photographers singers and painters whose special gifts and talents derive from global cultures They are often practicing artists who are willing to impart their skills and knowledge to students They may be the relatives of the students and faculties who make up our schools diverse classrooms and workplaces They may be professional artists or highly skilled hobbyists who maintain a particular global artistic tradition They are found in local communities in ethnic restaurants folk and art centers museums playhouses churches synagogues and mosques These global artists can create the critical context for the presentation and appreciation of the arts from around the world The opportunities for such educational and artistic interactions are endless for example a Hispanic trumpet player explaining the Mexican mariachi tradition a Hardingfele fiddle player demonstrating various styles common to Norwegian folk dances or an African sculptor explaining the ritual significance of a mask Many other artists can elucidate diverse aspects of global arts Model visiting artists and artistinresidence programs exist throughout the country among College Board member institutions Sharing these programs through the College Boards vast Webbased communications network will provide an opportunity for member institutions to have easy access to global artists and provide students and teachers with new cross cultural experiences as well as the opportunity to peer into the globalized world through the arts Through its regional structure the College Board is in a position to mobilize its vast membership and to use this memberships diverse resources to take action toward promoting the place of the arts in education In addition we urge the College Board to continue to build alliances with likeminded arts and education institutions to support the arts in K education as outlined below Initiate and sustain alliances with arts and education organizations to develop collaborations that support the arts in K education a Provide information to its member institutions in order to promote partnerships with community organizations that provide arts experiences and education to underserved populations b Initiate and sustain alliances with arts and education organizations in order to share resources research results and policy goals on arts education c Promote opportunities for global artists who reside in our communities to participate in arts education programs and activities Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Conclusion Centralizing Knowledge and Information In todays fast paced highly technological world the Internet is often the first place that people look for information on organizations A Web page is an important marketing and communication tool for any organization or initiative At the present there is minimal commitment to arts programs at the College Board and those that are offered are embedded in the Web pages of other programs making it hard for the public to find them Throughout this report and embedded within our recommendations we have suggested that the College Board create an online presence for the arts in the form of a Web page with a proposed title of Arts at the Core The College Board has spent considerable time and effort engaging in a dialogue and soliciting advice from its membership as well as from leaders of high profile arts and education organizations Establishing an Arts at the Core Web page is a costeffective way of demonstrating the College Boards continued commitment to this valued effort A Web page would also provide a means to continue the College Boards alignments with these important organizations and to communicate with and update the College Board membership on arts programming after the conclusion of the task forces work The Web page would serve as a central location to share and promote the task forces findings and recommendations communicate with the College Board membership about the arts and continue to build alliances with prominent educational and arts organizations and institutions In addition if more arts initiatives are developed as a result of the recommendations in this report the Web page will serve to bring this new programming as well as the College Boards current arts offerings to the fore The College Board can become the hub that links the multiple national and regional arts education organizations As the conduit for promoting and communicating the centrality of the arts in education nationwide the College Board can help train principals in ways their teachers can use the arts to enrich their curricula through dissemination of personal examples and videos With the College Board as the hub consistency among states standards will develop and attention to the standards will increase enabling principals who might not approve programs that are otherwise not tied to states standards to become more cognizant of them Colleges will evaluate applicants arts experience more critically in their admission processes and best practices for arts education developed by members of the multiple arts education organizations can be shared more readily Connecting Students and Teachers The NTFAE also believes that this Web page might serve as the best conduit for students input and participation in the College Boards arts programming Todays students use multiple electronic devices to talk to each other to receive and share information and ideas to write their musical scores and produce their digital photographs and even to receive their lesson plans from their teachers Setting up an Arts at the Core Web page would connect students directly to the College Board to their teachers and to one another Teachers could learn from the model programs that would be represented on the website as well as communicate with one another through the message boards or chat rooms Short Web clips can allow teachers to see best practices in the classroom and view student work The Levine Production Group has created an arts education video series and the NTFAE recommends that the College Board stream these workshops on the College Board Web page This collaboration has the potential to become the core of a workshop on arts education at a regional or national College Board forum The vision of stcentury learning includes an emphasis on creativity and innovation A Web page that exhibits the College Boards commitment to arts and creativity would strengthen the College Boards image and relevance as a leading educational organization This Web page also would strengthen the College Boards image by demonstrating that it is not exclusively a productdriven organization The College Board is concerned with advancing the educational opportunities of underserved student populations As stated throughout this report evidence continually shows that the arts improve success rates of atrisk student populations Therefore advocating for and supporting the arts in education is relevant to the College Boards mission to connect all students to college success Establishing an Arts at the Core Web page that communicates the College Boards efforts in the arts strengthens the image of the College Board as an organization whose reach expands beyond its products Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century In the modern age we have little choice but to engage in continuous improvement to our educational system to meet the demands of the everchanging world around us Throughout this report the NTFAE advocates for a reassessment of the pedagogies practices and curricula pathways used in classrooms in order to integrate more effectively the arts into education The report bears out the NTFAEs basic premise that the arts should serve students needs and aspirations and that professional development programs for teachers should embrace the arts A common set of themes held true during the NTFAEs deliberations K schools must continue to reassess their educational mission the priorities they set and their current resource allocations to provide a more substantial basis for the furtherance of the arts in education and placing the arts at the core of education requires the mobilization of a broad range of stakeholders both inside and outside of the halls of learning Implementation and enactment of the task forces eight recommendations require the collective knowledge and experience of key collaborators these joint efforts will serve to identify the obvious barriers and provide the necessary solutions to the curricular imbalances that exist in our educational systems Change is difficult but it is necessary to enhance and improve our students exposure to and participation in the arts and to ensure their educational success As stated throughout this report studies by psychologists and neuroscientists have revealed that arts can have a persistent effect on the cognitive development in children Other research findings acknowledge that the arts contribute to students critical thinking and problemsolving skills which carry over into their performance in other academic areas namely the STEM science technology engineering and mathematics disciplines Therefore the arts in schools must be a part of strategic plans that seek depth and breadth in the curriculum Motivated by that fact the NTFAE took an approach to its work that focuses on the benefits and opportunities the arts contribute to the learning experiences of all students There is yet another dimension of arts learning to consider In the broader scheme of things our schools must also serve to nurture the talents of those students who excel in the arts those who show extraordinary creative skills and will use their school arts experiences to launch them into the ranks of professionals A cursory survey of todays highly acclaimed dancers musicians visual artists and theatrical performers will reveal that many became interested in and displayed artistic skills while they were students Having our schools prepared to serve the aspiration of all students constitutes the major reasons this report focuses on the professional development of teachers the integration of the arts across the curriculum and by all means the interests creative skills and artistic aspirations of our students The NTFAE did not venture deeply into the philosophical and theoretical aspects of the arts in human life However it must be stressed that the concepts and aesthetics which are deeply embedded in the arts are essential in students sense of themselves and of others and may provide the moral bases for the manner in which they negotiate their paths in this ever increasingly globalized world A balanced educational experience which includes the arts is one that prepares our students to live as productive members of society The content and recommendations contained in this report emerged from the thoughtful and engaging conversations with the dozens of arts and education leaders invited to the task force meetings in and and from the NTFAE inquiries and discussions over the past two years We hope they will provide the Board of Trustees and others with a framework for moving the arts in education agenda forward The College Board has the ability the influence and the programmatic structure to carry these

Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Appendix B Merging the Arts and History Sample Lesson Ideas Below are a few examples of how the arts can be used to improve teaching and learning across the curriculum to underline the assertion that the arts should be seen as core subjects The art of the Dutch masters includes hundreds of scenes of everyday activities that both illustrate and add to our understanding of daily life in the Netherlands in the th century Using words alone is akin to presenting this material in only two dimensions whereas the same words accompanied by paintings with students describing and analyzing what they are viewing gives the presentation a captivating third dimension At the turn of the th century the illustrations and written insights and analyses of Maria Sibylla Merian provided the visual and scientific foundation for what is known about insect metamorphosis The martial music of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Empire not only introduced to the West the powerful role that music can play in military engagements but also listening to a selection of this music while studying the history of the period brings that history to life inside ones head as nothing else can Similarly Krzysztof Pendereckis Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima adds a powerful if screeching dimension to photographs of what happened to one Japanese city on August Students acting out scenes from Molieres Le Bourgeois gentilhomme a comedyballet will learn about the mores and permutations of middleclass life in Frances Ancien rgime just as those who act out scenes from Karel Capeks RUR will discover both the fears their thcentury ancestors had about automation and whether those fears were justified from our stcentury perspective And being introduced to dances music and costumes from around the globe speaks to the universality of artistic expression and to the way culture can serve as a bridge to what otherwise often sets us human beings apart For further examples of how the arts and history are merged successfully in the classroom see Robert Blackey To Illuminate History Making History PicturePerfect Teaching History A Journal of Methods Fall Arts at the Core Recommendations for Advancing the State of Arts Education in the st Century Appendix C DRAFT PROPOSAL An International Arts Exchange The College Boards National Task Force on the Arts in Education proposes the following Given the complexities of our globalized world a greater understanding between cultures is crucial to a civilized future everyones future The NTFAE proposes a variation on a proven course of action one that has been utilized several times in our modern era the use of the arts as a vehicle for bringing cultures together While this is not a new concept this proposal differs in this regard the artists are not professionals they are secondary school students who would be selected by the College Board from throughout the United States Exhibitions by AP art students would travel throughout the world and be accompanied by student spokespersons an AP teacher and a collegelevel teacher music performances including instrumentalists and vocal groups would be scheduled in a similar fashion Programs also would be presented via existing video documents etc that would put on display and communicate the length and breadth of the arts in our educational system To complement this program the College Board would arrange to host a variety of equivalent groups from countries throughout the world In this fashion the arts especially at this level could have a genuine role in shaping the future of international cultural understanding We also believe this would have an enormous impact on all U S students in realizing that what they producelearn in their arts courses is seen as a vital component of the future of all students and all cultures As a result the College Board would be seen as a most innovative

Arts Education All rights reserved Contents Executive Summary Introduction The Status of Arts Education in New York City Public Schools Our Study Arts Education and New York City Graduation Rates Conclusion Policy Recommendations Appendix Endnotes References In New York City the cultural capital of the world public school students do not enjoy equal access to an arts education In fact in schools with the lowest graduation rates where the arts could have the greatest impactstudents have the least opportunity to participate in arts learning This report takes the first ever look at the relationship between schoolbased arts education and high school graduation rates in New York City public schools The findings based on data collected by the New York City Department of Education DOE strongly suggest that the arts play a key role in keeping students in high school and graduating on time In several national studies over the past decade students at risk of dropping out cite participation in the arts as their reason for staying in school The failure of public high schools to graduate students in four years has been a persistent problem in New York City and is a central concern for educators and policymakers across the nation Once the worldwide leader in education the United States is falling behind other countries in a number of educational categories none of which is more troubling than high school graduation rates In several national studies over the past decade students at risk of dropping out cite participation in the arts as their reason for staying in school Research has also shown that arts education has had a measurable impact on atrisk youth in deterring delinquent behavior and truancy problems while also increasing overall academic performance Despite these known benefits as the findings of this report confirm New York City public school students at schools with the lowest graduation rates have the least access to instruction in the arts Analyzing data from more than New York City schools over a twoyear period this report shows that schools in the top third in graduation rates offered their students the most access to arts education and the most resources that support arts education Schools in the bottom third in graduation rates consistently offer the least access and fewest resources This pattern held true for nine key indicators that convey a schools commitment to arts education The findings are summarized below Certified Arts Teachers High schools in the top third of graduation rates had almost percent more certified arts teachers per student than schools in the bottom thirdor on average one additional arts teacher per school Dedicated Arts Classrooms High schools in the top third of graduation rates had percent more physical spaces dedicated to arts learning per student than schools in the bottom third Appropriately Equipped Arts Classrooms High schools in the top third of graduation rates had almost percent more classrooms appropriately equipped for the arts than schools in the bottom third Arts and Cultural Partnerships High schools in the top third of graduation rates had fostered percent more partnerships with arts and cultural organizations than schools in the bottom third Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates External Funds to Support the Arts High schools in the top third of graduation rates were percent more likely to have raised funds from external sources to support the arts than schools in the bottom third Coursework in the Arts High schools in the top third of graduation rates had almost percent more graduates completing three or more arts courses than schools in the bottom third Access to Multiyear Arts Sequence High schools in the top third of graduation rates were almost percent more likely to offer students a multiyear sequence in the arts than schools in the bottom third School Sponsorship of Student Arts Participation High schools in the top third of graduation rates were more likely to have offered students an opportunity to participate or perform in one or more arts activities than schools in the bottom third School Sponsorship of Arts Field Trips High schools in the top third of graduation rates were more likely to have offered students an opportunity to attend an arts activity such as a theater performance dance recital or museum exhibit than schools in the bottom third These findings suggest that increasing students access to arts instruction in schools with low graduation rates can be a successful strategy for lifting graduation rates and turning around struggling schools not just in New York City but nationwide And while the central focus of the report is arts education at the high school level the benefits that participating in arts learning imparts to students are just as pronounced in the lower grades In fact for students to benefit fully from high school arts instruction it is critical that they acquire the increased level of knowledge and understanding that comes with coursework in earlier grades Thirteen years ago the New York State Education Department NYSED established a set of rigorous learning standards and regulations that confirms the value of instruction in the artsmusic dance theater and visual artfor all students K through According to data provided in the New York City Department of Educations Annual Arts in Schools Reports however the great majority of schools in New York City are out of compliance with these state mandatesin fact only percent of elementary schools and less than half of middle schools make the grade This study also points to unequal access to arts education in city high schools based on socioeconomic background race or ethnicity Schools with the lowest graduation rates had a higher percentage of poor black and Latino students than schools with the highest graduation rates This secondary association could be an indication of an inequitable system that sustains educational and income disparities and is worthy of further study Our analysis which associates arts education and graduation rates by school rather than by individuals buttresses our ongoing argument that arts education is an essential component of K through public school education The recommendations in this report reflect our vision of quality arts education for all students and the glaring need to address the deficiencies and inequities that exist throughout the system In addition to calling on high school principals to expand course offerings in all four arts disciplines so that students can at least meet the minimum graduation requirements the report urges the New York State Education Department to ensure compliance with the state standards and regulations currently in place The recommendations also call for the city to restore Project Arts a policy initiative created in that guaranteed a minimum amount of funding for arts education in every school Restoring this initiative could once again serve to catalyze the hiring of certified arts teachers at schools the purchasing of instruments and supplies and the fostering of arts education partnerships with the citys rich array of arts and cultural organizations at all schools These and other key artsfriendly policies summarized on the following page and presented in detail in the Recommendations section can help ensure greater access to an arts education for New York City public school students and play a key role in addressing the citys graduation crisis The Center for Arts Education EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Expand Course Offerings in the Arts High school principals should expand course offerings in the four arts disciplines The New York State Board of Regents and the State Education Department should review the graduation requirements and examine the benefits of increasing the minimum requirement to three arts courses Expand Student Access to the Citys Cultural Arts Sector The city should implement policies and dedicate resources to ensure that all students have access to the citys cultural arts sector Ensure All Schools Have Certified Arts Teachers Every school should have at minimum one certified arts teacher on staff Require Adequate Classroom Space for Arts Instruction The city should require that all schools provide adequate space for arts instruction The formula used for determining a schools capacity should reflect this requirement The city should conduct an inventory of classrooms utilized for arts instruction including a survey of the number and former use of arts spaces that have been repurposed These spaces should be reclaimed for arts instruction Arts spaces should be incorporated into the design and construction of all future school facilities Dedicate Resources to Support Arts Instruction Principals should be held accountable for spending funds received through the Project Arts budget line exclusively on arts education The city should expand to arts teachers the existing financial incentives to attract and retain certified teachers in highneeds areas The city should support and expand approaches for sharing arts teachers and teaching artists among small high schools Ensure School Compliance with Existing State Regulations for Arts Instruction The New York State Education Department should conduct a thorough and periodic audit of compliance with the New York State education regulations for the arts and develop a comprehensive intervention program for districts and schools out of compliance The New York State Education Department should create an expedited certification program for nonarts subject area teachers to attain certification in any the four recognized arts forms The New York State Education Department City Comptroller or other government entity should conduct an investigation and issue a public report on New York City high school compliance with graduation requirements Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates The national graduation crisis has reached epidemic proportions More than one million students across the United States drop out of high school each year Moreover nearly one third of all high school students and nearly half of all African Americans Latinos and Native Americans fail to graduate from public high school on time The crisis is especially pronounced in New York City where the fouryear graduation rate for the class of was a dismal percent Of that class the graduation rates for Latino and African American students were percent and percent respectively In contrast White and Asian students graduated with rates of percent and percent respectively While students fail to finish high school for myriad reasonsranging from socioeconomic issues to a lack of interest in the curriculumin a recent national survey of ethnically diverse high school dropouts more than half of the respondents said that the major reason for dropping out of high school was that they felt their classes were uninteresting and irrelevant It should be noted that some students who do not graduate in four years eventually receive their diploma On the other hand more than percent of the class of were dischargedthat is removed from the citys enrollment rolls without officially dropping out or graduating The consequences of the graduation crisis are both painful and sustained Dropouts are much more likely than graduates to be unemployed or living in poverty in prison or on death row unhealthy divorced or single parents with children who drop out of high school themselves These outcomes are particularly evident in New York City where one in every five young people is out of school and out of work Studies attest to the success of strong arts programs as a means to prevent the disengagement that usually predicts dropping out Arts education has a measurable impact in deterring delinquent behavior and truancy problems and students at risk of not successfully completing their high school education cite their participation in the arts as a reason for staying in school The opportunity for students to engage in the artsthrough bands and choruses dance and theater productions exhibitions of their original art and publications of original literary and visual workhas always been a strong motivator for students and can play a key role in tackling the graduation crisis The findings in this report reinforce the observation that the arts help keep students interested in school and on the path to graduation In a recent national survey of ethnically diverse high school dropouts more than half of the respondents said that the major reason for dropping out of high school was that they felt their classes were uninteresting and irrelevant The Center for Arts Education INTRODUCTION By virtually every economic measure high school graduates are better positioned to lead successful adult lives than those who fail to receive their diploma According to Cities in Crisis a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of the graduation crisis earning a diploma increases the likelihood of steady employment by percent and cuts the chances of experiencing poverty in half The median income for someone without a high school diploma was slightly more than annually in compared to the median income for high school graduates of almost Over their lifetimes graduates earn an estimated million more than high school dropouts High school graduation impacts not only individuals but also the nation and the economy as a whole Graduates contribute more to the tax base and take less public assistance than students who drop out The Alliance for Excellent Education a national policy and advocacy organization that works to increase graduation rates estimates that if the students from the class of who dropped out had graduated the nations economy would have benefited from nearly billion in additional income over the course of their lifetimes According to US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan The arts can help students become tenacious team oriented problemsolvers who are confident and able to think creatively These qualities can be especially important in improving learning among students from economically disadvantaged circumstances There is growing evidence that the arts contribute to learning across disciplines and to the thought process itself In March the Dana Foundation released a series of studies conducted by leading neuroscientists from six prestigious universities demonstrating a tight correlation between exposure to the arts and improved skills in cognition and attention for learning At a symposium in May at Johns Hopkins University several scientists showed evidence of the near transfer from one part of the brain to another of measurable learning and attention abilities attained through arts learning experiences These recent findings are reinforced by a body of work that highlights the positive impact of arts learning on student achievement and academic success In a wellregarded US Department of Education study that examined data for middle and high school students students who were highly involved in the arts performed better on standardized achievement tests than those with little or no involvement in the arts Moreover the students involved in the arts participated in more community service watched fewer hours of television and reported less boredom in school The College Board found that students engaged in arts learning for all four years of high school scored substantially higher on the SAT than students with six months or less training in the arts points higher on verbal and points higher on math The arts can help students become tenacious teamoriented problemsolvers who are confident and able to think creatively These qualities can be especially important in improving learning among students from economically disadvantaged circumstances Arne Duncan US Secretary of Education Studies show that access to arts education in school offers distinct benefits to economically disadvantaged youth and students at risk of dropping out An year national study that examined youth in lowincome neighborhoods found that those who participated in arts programs were much more likely to be high academic achievers be elected to class office participate in a math or science fair or win an award for writing an essay or poem According to a multicity US Department of Justice study arts programming not only increased academic performance of those students involved in the project but also decreased juvenile delinquency and drug use increased selfesteem and led to more positive interactions with peers and adults Students themselves have attributed many of the benefits realized through arts education to the increased interaction with caring and supportive arts instructors and educators as well as to an increase in selfesteem and sense of achievement gained through the learning opportunities Once students experience success in arts classes they are better able to understand the benefits and the process of the hard work that goes into all learning Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates At the beginning of the school year the New York City Department of Education introduced ArtsCount an initiative aimed at enhancing arts education in New York City public schools A centerpiece of this initiative was the development of a series of metrics on the arts education taking place in city schools As part of this effort in spring the DOE released the first ever citywide Annual Arts in Schools Report for the school year along with individual reports for each school That was followed by a second Annual Arts in Schools Report for the school year several months later The reports based on surveys completed by principals toward the end of the school year have provided the most comprehensive reporting on arts education in New York City public schools in recent memory They make clear that access to arts education in public schools is far from universal While some schools offer enviable arts programs many have little to no arts education whatsoeverno art teachers on staff no classrooms dedicated to the arts no partnerships with arts or cultural organizations and minimal student participation in any of the four required art forms The DOEs Office of the Arts and Special Projects has been actively providing information and resources to help schools that are underserved in the arts While many schools have made great strides comparing data from the two Annual Arts in Schools Reports reveals year overyear declines in several key arts education areas Nearly percent of schools had no certified arts teacher on staff in up from percent the previous year Principals allocated a smaller percentage of their budgets to arts education in shrinking to less than percent on average Principals spent more than half a million dollars less on services provided by art and cultural partners in compared to the previous year There was a percent decline in spending on arts supplies and equipment in over the previous yeara reduction of nearly million These yearoveryear declines correspond to a decision by the current administration to all but eliminate a successful program that ensured that a minimum level of arts funding was being allocated at all schools on a perpupil basis The program Project Arts created in was a catalyst for hiring certified arts teachers purchasing supplies securing services of arts education providers and encouraging private contributions to match public dollars In categorical funding provided through Project Arts was folded into a schools overall budget and principals were no longer required to spend these funds on the arts Perhaps most troubling the Annual Arts in Schools Reports revealed that the great majority of the citys public schools were failing to meet the minimum state requirements for arts education as set by the New York State Education Department and outlined in Part of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education The Center for Arts Education THE STATUS OF ARTS EDUCATION IN NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS The regulations require that all elementary schools offer instruction in four arts disciplines visual arts music theater dance to every student that middle school and high school students complete a least one full unit of study two coursescredits in the arts and that each public school district provide high school students the opportunity to complete a three or fiveunit arts sequence These requirements are complemented by recommended guidelines developed by NYSED to ensure that students receive a balanced curriculum and New York State Learning Standards for the arts that express the educational goals for dance music theater and the visual arts The state requirements for arts instruction have the effect and power of law yet lack of compliance with these educational mandates is widespread throughout the New York City public school system According to the Annual Arts in Schools Reports at the elementary and middle school levels for example Only percent of elementary schools reported providing annual arts instruction in all four arts disciplines as per state requirements an improvement from percent the previous year report Only percent of middle school students met the state arts education requirement completion of two halfunit arts courses report Less than half of middle schools reported that all students had met state education requirements for the arts report The lack of compliance reported by the DOE was confirmed by the New York City Public Advocates office through a survey of randomly selected public elementary and randomly selected public middle schools The Public Advocates survey results show that Only percent of elementary schools surveyed offered instruction in all four arts disciplines as required by state regulations Sixtyeight percent of elementary schools and percent of middle schools surveyed offered only one or two arts disciplines Seven percent of elementary schools and percent of middle schools surveyed had no arts education at all The state requirements for arts instruction have the effect and power of law yet lack of compliance with these educational mandates is widespread throughout the New York City public school system The NYSED high school graduation requirements are minimal for the arts the completion of one unit two credits in the arts over the course of a students high school career In New York City one unit is defined as minutes per week throughout the school year or the equivalent It is recommended that the instruction be provided by a teacher certified to teach the particular subject area State regulations also require that each school district offer the opportunity to complete a three or fiveunit sequence in the arts As of students who complete five units in a single art form and successfully complete the exit exam in that art form are eligible to receive a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation in the Arts While providing New York City students with the minimum of two courses over four years should not be onerous neither the nor the Annual Arts in Schools Report states explicitly whether or not schools were meeting the requirements The two reports do however provide the following information which tracks the regulations most closely Seventynine percent of high schools offered instruction in two arts disciplines percent in three art forms and percent in all four arts disciplines report Twentynine percent of high schools offered at least one three or fiveyear sequence in the arts report Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates Fortysix percent of students in and percent in exceeded the state requirements by completing three or more arts courses reports Eightytwo percent of high schools had at least one certified arts teacher on staff report The following section takes a more indepth look at the data for high schools in the two Annual Arts in Schools Reports issued to date Specifically it looks at the relationship between the data provided on the arts in schools and graduation rates at city high schools Review of the reports and data presented above raised additional questions pertaining to city high schools that fall outside the scope of this report but are worthy of further study Specifically how are schools without certified arts teachers on staff ensuring that the New York State Learning Standards requirements and guidelines are being met To what degree are students meeting the requirements through the credit recovery process whereby students are given credits that count toward graduation for special projects or work done in lieu of coursework Also worth examining is the steep decline percent yearoveryear in the number of graduates who completed three or more arts courses The Center for Arts Education This section examines the relationship between graduation rates at more than New York City public high schools and the arts education provided at those schools It is based on an independent analysis of data compiled by the New York City Department of Education for the Annual Arts in Schools Reports for the and school years and graduation rate data provided separately by the DOE as part of the reporting on school Progress Reports The schools in the analysis are those for which data were available from both the arts reports as well as on graduation rates The schools were not identical for both school years as data for some schools were not available for both periods The analysis included a total of New York City high schools from the school year and from the school year Because the Annual Arts in Schools Reports do not report on afterschool weekend or summer arts education all data are based on arts instruction offered during the school day Each years set of schools was grouped into three tiers according to graduation rateslow middle and high with roughly equal numbers of schools in each tier We then looked at the relationship between graduation rates and the nine arts education indicators described below Due to the wide variation in the size of high schools in New York City we present the data for several of the indicators as a ratio of the indicator per students a number that roughly corresponds to the average student population of at the schools analyzed in this report The following nine arts education indicators are key components of the DOEs Annual Arts in Schools Reports and were selected for analysis in this report because they are fundamental measures of a schools ability and inclination to deliver arts education to its students We report the indicatorsdivided into two categories Resources and Accessas follows Resource Indicators Certified Arts Teachers reported as fulltime certified teachers per students Dedicated Arts Classrooms reported as dedicated arts rooms per students Appropriately Equipped Arts Classrooms reported as appropriately equipped arts rooms per students Arts and Cultural Partnerships reported as average number of partnerships per school External Funds to Support the Arts reported as percentage of schools raising any outside funds to support the arts Access Indicators Coursework in the Arts reported as percentage of graduates per school who completed three or more arts courses Access to Multiyear Arts Sequence reported as percentage of schools where any arts sequences were offered School Sponsorship of Student Arts Participation reported as percentage of schools that offered an opportunity for students to participate in one of the reported activities School Sponsorship of Arts Field Trips reported as percentage of schools that offered an opportunity for students to attend one of the reported activities Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates The findings for all nine indicators analyzed here are summarized in Table For each indicator schools in the high graduation tier showed a greater commitment to arts education than schools in the low graduation tier Schools in the middle tier also provided greater access and more resources to support arts education than schools in the low graduation tier across all indicators For two indicators school sponsorship of arts participation and sequential arts offering schools in the middle tier were slightly more artsfriendly than schools in the high tier Following is a more indepth look at the data and results for each of the nine indicators with a brief discussion of the findings as well as the significance of the measure Results are reported for both the and school years and also a twoyear average An expanded table with additional information eg average school size attendance rates demographic information etc can be found in the Appendix Resource Indicators Certified Arts Teachers The presence of certified arts teachers on a schools staff is a key indicator of a high schools commitment to arts education Arts teachers provide students and the school with the expertise necessary to provide quality instruction in the arts and create a school community that values arts education In addition to traditional classroom arts learning many schools deliver arts instruction through interdisciplinary or integrated learning opportunities that utilize the talents of a wider array of school staff While this approach has great value and has long been supported by The Center for Arts Education the hiring of certified arts teachers signals a schools engagement with arts education and the arts teachers are often the locus of interdisciplinary teaching in school Many small high schools do not have the resources space or size of student population to support a fulltime certified arts teacher on staff or an adequate array of faculty in general This is a continuing challenge faced by the citys small schools To a limited degree there already exists a sharing of staff amongst schools and artist Table ARTS EDUCATION INDICATORS AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE COMPARISON Two Year Average and Graduation Tier Arts Indicator Low Middle High Fulltime Certified

the Arts Graduates Who Completed Three or More Arts Classes Schools Offering Multiyear Arts Sequence School Sponsorship of Student Arts Participation School Sponsorship of Arts Field Trips residencies have been used in many schools to great effect However the development of flexible staffing structures to further address these challenges is necessary and should be encouraged High schools and middle schools are required to provide students with arts instruction by a certified teacher and NYSED recommends that those teachers be certified in the art form they are teaching As reported by the DOE in only percent of New York City high schools had certified arts teachers on staff Additionally according to NYSED arts is considered to be a shortage area for teachers statewide with New York City being the area with the highest needs in the state The Center for Arts Education OUR STUDY ARTS EDUCATION AND NEW YORK CITY GRADUATION RATES Due to the variation in high school size in New York City for this report we looked at the number of fulltime certified arts teachers at each school for every students A higher ratio of teachers to students can enhance learning in the arts as in other subject areas by allowing for more focused efforts by the teacher and oneonone interaction between teachers and students The citys larger high schools require multiple certified art teachers perhaps one in each art form to provide the requisite instruction to all their students While parttime certified teachers are also an important part of a schools arts program the DOE provided schoollevel data related to parttime instruction for only one of the two school years so this measure was not included in our analysis As illustrated in Figure schools in the high graduation tier had more fulltime certified arts teachers on staff per student than schools in the low graduation tier This holds true across both school years surveyed The high tier had four certified arts teachers for every students and the low tier had fewer than three certified arts teachers for every students According to the twoyear average schools in the high tier had percent more arts teachers than those in the low tieror one additional arts teacher for every students Dedicated Arts Classrooms Highquality equipment in arts classrooms as in libraries gyms and science labs supports quality teaching and learning It is nearly impossible for an arts teacher to deliver quality arts programming if required to move from room to room with supplies in a cart which is the reality in many schools across the city Likewise inadequate facilities hamper quality teaching and learning and lead to substandard student learning Based on the test results of the National Assessment of Education Progress NAEP widely considered the gold standard of educational assessment the US Department of Education found that students performed better in the arts when they were taught in proper arts spaces The size configuration specialized equipment and features required for art classrooms are unique for each art form Dance requires open space for movement Visual arts require space for students to create view and store projects as well as access to sinks and water Music and theater require rehearsal and performance space as well as proper storage space for instruments sheet music lights and props These particular needs Figure s t n e d u t S s r e h c a e T s t r A d e i f i t r e C Low Middle High Low Middle High Low Middle High TwoYear Average School Years and Graduation Tiers make it essential to design and furnish appropriate facilities during school construction and renovation Leaders in the field of arts education as well as school design experts have recommended that each school have at least one dedicated arts space for every to students The spaces and facilities available in schools to teach the arts are good indicators of the level of commitment to arts education US Department of Education NAEP Arts Report Card A dedicated arts classroom is a classroom used solely for arts instruction or performance The DOE recognizes that the ideal physical environment for arts learning is one that is dedicated to the arts discipline and appropriately and comfortably equipped with the specific equipment and supplies needed to optimize students experience According to the Annual Arts in Schools Report however percent of school leaders reported the lack of available inschool arts space as a challenge to providing arts educationthe most frequently cited challenge after funding percent Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates CERTIFIED ARTS TEACHERS AND GRADUATION RATES As illustrated in Figure students in the schools with the lowest graduation rates had the fewest rooms dedicated to arts learning More specifically according to the twoyear average schools in the high tier had one and a half more dedicated arts rooms per students than schools in the low tier or percent more classrooms dedicated to the arts While our datareporting method is not designed to compare different school years from Figure it appears that schools reported having more dedicated arts spaces in than they did in The anomaly could be due to the slightly larger sample size in which could have included schools with more arts classrooms or a data or reporting inconsistency between the two years With principals reporting the need to convert dedicated spaces for the arts and other subjects to general classroom use due to school overcrowding it is unlikely although not impossible that the data reflect an actual growth in the number of spaces dedicated to the arts Appropriately Equipped Arts Classrooms In the absence of dedicated spaces rooms equipped to serve the art form but shared with other subject areas can be effective uses of space and resources and if tailored appropriately can be adequate substitutes for many but not all arts classes The DOE classifies classrooms that have the materials and equipment needed to teach the art form as appropriately equipped classrooms whether or not they are used for this purpose or are shared with nonarts subject areas According to the DOE dedicated and appropriately equipped spaces are not mutually exclusive the Annual Arts in Schools Reports survey advised school leaders that rooms can be both dedicated and appropriately equipped As demonstrated in Figure schools in the high tier of graduation rates had percent more appropriately equipped classrooms than those in the low tier There were appropriately equipped classrooms for every students in schools in the low graduation tier compared to for every students in schools in the high tier according to the twoyear average Figure s t n e d

EQUIPPED ARTS CLASSROOMS AND GRADUATION RATES OUR STUDY ARTS EDUCATION AND NEW YORK CITY GRADUATION RATES Arts and Cultural Partnerships One of the benefits of living and attending school in New York City is access to its vibrant arts and cultural sector In addition to having opportunities to see live performances and visit museums many students attend schools that partner with arts or cultural organizations Partnerships between schools and outside arts and cultural organizations deepen not only arts learning opportunities for participating students but also learning across curriculums Often the school and cultural partner collaborate to design and implement programs where the partner comes into the classroom to lead sequential sessions around a particular theme that enhance and enrich the classroom curriculum When such partnerships become an integral part of a schools vision learning through experiences with arts and cultural institutions becomes an energizing force in the school community Successful partnerships also echo beyond the school walls as students and staff are connected to community resources in new and engaging ways Unfortunately not all students have equal access to these partnerships It is commonly understood that such partnerships vary widely from a single workshop serving a single class to a yearlong multifaceted design that serves multiple classes in multiple grades While the DOE provided information to help describe the nature of these partnerships on an individual school basis the information was either not suitable for the type of analysis conducted in this report or the data provided were not consistent over the two years Figure displays the results of the analysis of the number of cultural partnerships into which each school has entered As the figure illustrates schools with the highest graduation rates on average forged percent more partnerships with cultural organizations per school than those with the lowest graduation rates External Funds to Support the Arts School expenditures for arts education are often augmented by contributions from external sources such as parents local businesses government agencies or corporate or private foundations The funds raised from external sources can be spent in many ways including hiring additional part or fulltime teachers and teachers Figure l o o h c S s p i h s r e n

school trips to museums and other cultural centers or helping to subsidize partnerships with arts organizations to name a few While the ability of schools to raise outside funds is partly dependent on the ability of parents to contribute it also reflects the resourcefulness and determination of school leadership to engage outside entities to support the arts in school According to the Annual Arts in Schools Report for on average schools raised from external funding sources with the highest percentage coming from ParentTeacher Associations percent As there were significant flaws in the schoolbyschool reporting of the dollar amount raised this analysis focuses solely on whether or not any funds were raised from outside sources As illustrated in Figure schools in the high graduation tier were percent more likely to have raised funds from external sources to support the arts than schools in the bottom tier According to the twoyear average only percent of schools in the low tier raised any outside arts funding while percent of schools in the high tier raised outside funds during that time frame Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates ARTS AND CULTURAL PARTNERSHIPSAND GRADUATION RATES As mentioned above the level of money raised from outside sources in many ways reflects parental engagement and wherewithal to make financial contributions Schools with students from wealthier backgrounds generally raise more money and have more resources at their disposal to supplement their budgets In poorer communities parents generally raise less This disparity in what schools can offer students ultimately translates into more limited inschool and afterschool programming and instruction for low income studentspointing to the importance of minimum requirements and funding mechanisms to ensure that the mandates are met during the school day Some view such minimums as unwarranted bureaucratic hurdles or restrictions on principal autonomy The inequities evident throughout the city testify to the critical necessity of minimum requirements and dedicated funding lines because they establish an equitable floor for minimum student participation in the arts and ensure the accountability of school leaders for providing balanced standardsbased arts education for all students One third more students took three or more arts classes at schools with high graduation rates than did students in schools with low graduation rates Access Indicators Coursework in the Arts A variety of arts courses signals a robust high school arts program While smaller schools face limitations the citys larger high schools are expected to offer students multiple classes in most disciplines New York State regulations require one unit of credit the equivalent of two classes total instructional hours in the arts in order to graduate but many students choose to exceed those requirements when and where offered the opportunity As illustrated in Figure on the following page students in schools in the low graduation tier are significantly less likely to have taken three or more arts classes before they graduated than their peers in schools in the high tier Specifically over the twoyear average one third more students percent took three or more arts classes at schools with high graduation rates than did students in schools with low graduation rates Figure s t r A e h t r o f g n i d n u F l a n r e t x E d e s i a R t a h T s l o o h c S Low Middle High Low Middle High Low Middle High TwoYear Average School Years and Graduation Tiers This gap in the number of arts courses being taken by graduates is significant in that it ties directly to individual students coursework over their high school years and is perhaps the most unambiguous sign of the disparity in student participation in the arts for the schools analyzed It could be argued that students in the low tier are choosing not to take coursework in the arts however based on the overall findings in this report it more likely signals a lack of opportunity at schools in the low graduation tier While the DOE provided no data on the number of arts courses offered at individual schools it is commonly recognized that many schools offer only the bare minimum so their students have no opportunity to exceed the requirement In fact the data revealed that percent of high schools were offering coursework in only one arts discipline or less limiting student course options The Center for Arts Education EXTERNAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ARTSAND GRADUATION RATES OUR STUDY ARTS EDUCATION AND NEW YORK CITY GRADUATION RATES Given the national studies in which atrisk students cite arts participation as their reason for staying in school increasing course offerings in the arts in the low graduation schools is likely to be an effective way to improve student engagement at those schools Access to Multiyear Arts Sequence An arts sequence is a set of sequential courses that build upon each other in any of the four main artistic disciplines dance theater music visual art Sequential coursework allows interested students to pursue advanced learning in the offered arts disciplines and provides students with a preprofessional andor academic track in the arts New York State education regulations require that each school district offer students the opportunity to complete a three or fiveunit sequence in any of the four recognized arts disciplines beginning in grade nine Because New York City is considered a single school district the state requirement is technically satisfied In light of the size of the district however the DOE has made a commitment to ensure that every community school district of which there are offers a sequence in each of the four arts disciplines Beginning with the class of students are now able to earn a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation in the Arts by completing five units in a single art form and successfully completing the exit exam in that art form This is a welcome development yet a students opportunity to earn this advanced designation will be largely dependent on whether or not their school offers a multiyear sequence According to the twoyear average in Figure schools in the high graduation tier were nine percent more likely to offer an arts sequence than those in the low tier For the school year however a greater percentage of schools in the low tier offered an arts sequence the reverse of the results from the previous school year This is the one data point in the analysis that was inconsistent with all others While it is possible that the schools in the low tier increased their offerings in relation to those in the high tier it is more likely that reporting inconsistencies were at play as is likely with a system of selfreporting Figure e e r h T d e t e l p m o C o h W s e t a u d a r G s e s r u o C s t r A e r o M r o Figure e c n e u q e S s t r A r a

processes that constitute creation and performance in the arts is invaluable to student learning in the art form To measure student participation for the two Annual Arts in Schools Reports principals were asked to indicate with a yes or no the types of arts activities that the school sponsored from a list of activities provided by the DOE on the Arts in Education Survey As the survey did not request actual student participation rates this indicator is not an accurate measure of true student participation it should be refined by the DOE in the future to more accurately capture this critical information For the purposes of this analysis we grouped together all the activities reported by the DOE and distinguished solely between schools that had any student participation in an arts activity and schools that had none Student attendance at arts activities is not only a way to build an appreciation of the arts it can also give high school students new ideas about future career paths and reasons to stay in school As illustrated in Figure a high percentage of schools in every tier had some student participation in an arts activity Despite a slight difference between schools in the high and low tiers the graph would imply that even those schools with low graduation rates were providing students with ample opportunity to participate in an arts activity As mentioned above the reporting on this measure is misleading because the DOE gave schools credit for student participation irrespective of how many students actually participated Also worthy of note is that the data for the school year included additional categories of student participation participated in concert performance showed studentmade film that were not reported in the previous year which most likely explains the increased level of participation for that Figure y n A d e r o s n o p S t a h T s l o o h c S n o i t a p i c i t r a P s t r A t n e d u t S Low Middle High Low Middle High Low Middle

sponsored Schools received full credit for sponsoring an activity regardless of the number of students who participated As illustrated in Figure a high percentage of schools across all tiers reported student attendance at an art activity Nonetheless schools in the low tier were noticeably less likely than schools in the high tier to have offered students an opportunity to attend an arts activity Given the generous definition of sponsorship it is reasonable to assume that an even greater discrepancy exists in the percentage of students at these schools who had the opportunity to attend one of the activities sponsored It is worth noting that data provided for included an additional category of activity viewed filmmedia which can explain the increased level of participation of over the previous school year Figure d e r o s n o p S t a h T s l o o h c S s p i r T d l e i F s t r A y n A Low Middle High Low Middle High Low Middle High TwoYear Average School Years and Graduation Tiers

are struggling most to keep their students on track to graduate are offering the least in the way of music theater dance and visual artsall subject areas that have welldocumented success in motivating students to stay in school The struggling schools have fewer arts teachers fewer arts classrooms and fewer cultural partnerships among a host of other disparities The analysis further shows that schools offering students the most access to arts education have the highest graduation rates Beyond the traditional benefits that an arts education providesthe opportunity to learn to play an instrument to express oneself through dance and movement to develop creative and critical thinking skills and the ability to work collaboratively with peersthe arts cut across learning styles and language barriers and engage students who might otherwise be uninterested in school and on a path to dropping out The arts give students something to look forward to and in New York City a school system with one of the lowest graduation rates in the country engagement is critical The findings suggest that both locally and nationally we need to take into account the benefits of arts education when addressing the graduation crisis and improving struggling high schools Strategies that rely on intervention only when students are on the verge of dropping out are insufficient Relying on a credit recovery process or discharging the habitually truant to mask a portion of systemic failure does not contribute to school improvement Curriculum and instruction do matterand participation in the arts has been shown to produce positive outcomes for students School and education leaders would be well advised to expand their approach to school reform by providing a greater array of course offerings and resources to support learning in and through the arts This is true not only for high schools Students at all grade levels benefit from a robust arts education Indeed for students to fully reap the benefits of high school arts instruction it is critical that they build on a solid foundation of knowledge and understanding that comes with coursework in earlier grades New York State has some of the most rigorous and well developed learning standards for arts instruction in the nation Adhering to the states standards and requirements would be a valuable first step toward ensuring that every student receive a minimum level of instruction in the arts regardless of socioeconomic background their school leadership or the uncertainties of the budget process To that end the State Education Department should develop a protocol to ensure compliance with existing mandates at public schools in New York City and across the state The section that follows outlines several other policy recommendations that would improve schools through a renewed emphasis on providing quality arts education at all grade levels Implementing these recommendations would ensure that all of New York Citys million public school students would gain greater access to the benefits that an arts education has to offer The Center for Arts Education The following recommendations are designed to ensure greater access to arts education in city high schools particularly schools currently underserved in the arts These recommendations can further be expanded to apply to schools at all levels Expand Course Offerings in the Arts As demonstrated in this report one third more graduates exceeded the minimum course requirements in the arts at schools with high graduation rates compared with their peers in schools with low graduation rates Providing students with a wider array of course offerings in the arts should be a priority of principals at schools with low graduation rates High school principals should expand course offerings in the four arts disciplines and provide all students with an opportunity to exceed the minimum graduation requirement of successful completion of two courses one unit of credit in the arts The New York State Board of Regents and the State Education Department should review the graduation requirements and examine the benefits of increasing the minimum requirement to three courses in the arts Expand Student Access to the Citys Cultural Arts Sector New York Citys array of arts and cultural resources can enrich the education and lives of its schoolchildren While many schools take advantage of these opportunities the findings in this report suggest that access to these resourcesthrough attendance at events or exhibits and cultural partnershipsis not equitable across schools Providing greater access for all students should be a goal for school leaders policymakers cultural institutions and other relevant stakeholders The city should implement policies and dedicate resources to ensure that all students have access to the citys vibrant and diverse cultural arts sector Ensure All Schools Have Certified Arts Teachers With approximately percent of high schools and percent of schools overall lacking a certified arts teacher on staff the city is falling short in the effort to provide students with instruction by a teacher certified in the subject area they teach Education leaders should ensure that all schools have an adequate number of certified arts teachers on staff to meet the state requirements especially at high schools struggling to graduate students on time These teachers should work in tandem with teaching artists and nonarts subject area teachers at each school and be provided ample opportunity to participate in professional development in the arts Every school should have at minimum one certified arts teacher on staff in one of the four required art forms with larger schools hiring a sufficient number to ensure that instructional requirements are met The city should expand to arts teachers the financial incentives already in use to attract and retain certified teachers in other highneeds areas to address the current recognized shortage of arts teachers that exists in the city public school system The city should support and expand approaches for sharing arts teachers and teaching artists among small high schools The New York State Education Department in partnership with the states institutions of higher learning should create an expedited certification program extension certificate for nonarts subject area teachers who have an arts background to attain certification in any of the four recognized arts forms Staying in School Arts Education and New York City High School Graduation Rates Ensure School Compliance with Existing State Regulations for Arts Instruction Ensuring compliance with laws already in place would be an important step in reducing educational inequities and providing students with the arts instruction outlined by the State Education Department from kindergarten through graduation At the high school level this would ensure that schools offer students the requisite credits and coursework taught by certified teachers and the opportunity to take a multiyear arts sequence in at least one of the four arts forms The New York State Education Department should conduct a thorough and periodic audit of compliance with the New York State education regulations for arts instruction throughout the state and develop a comprehensive intervention program for districts and schools found to be out of compliance The New York State Education Department City Comptroller or other government entity should investigate and issue a public report on New York City high school compliance with graduation requirements including an examination of how students at schools without certified arts teachers are meeting the graduation requirements how prevalent the credit recovery process is for arts instruction and how schools ensure that the states rigorous learning standards and requirements are being met through the credit recovery process Require Adequate Classroom Space for Arts Instruction The disparities in access to dedicated and appropriately equipped arts classrooms described in this report coupled with official recognition from both the New York City Department of Education and the US Department of Education about the importance of arts spaces to quality arts instruction should lead the city to ensure that all schools are adequately equipped to support instruction in the arts The city should require that all schools provide adequate space for arts instruction The formula used for determining a schools capacity should reflect this requirement The city should conduct an inventory of spaces dedicated to and used for arts instruction in each of its public schools including a survey of the number and former use of arts spaces that have been repurposed and are no longer used for arts instruction These spaces should be reclaimed for arts instruction where the need exists Arts spaces should be incorporated into the design and construction of all future school facilities Dedicate Resources to Support Arts Instruction Project Arts was a catalyst in restoring arts education to city public schools after a sharp decline in the s Since the city lifted the requirement that principals spend Project Arts funds directly on the arts at the beginning of the school year there has been an overall decline in the percentage of a schools budget spent on the arts including a decrease in school spending on the hiring of arts teachers the purchase of supplies and instruments and the contracting of services from arts and cultural organizations to deliver arts education directly to students Restoring this mandated perpupil allocation for all schools would spur investment in these core elements of a vibrant arts education program Principals should once again be held accountable for spending funds they receive through the Project Arts budget line exclusively on arts education The Center for Arts Education

Education in public schools has been elevated to a national conversation in recent years Education policymakers researchers and practitioners alike with overwhelming support from parents and community members agree that the visual and performing arts are essential to every childs education Indeed a number of communities in California are engaged in the development of regional plans for arts education and have committed substantial resources to the implementation of those plansmost notably Los Angeles Unified San Francisco Unified the Los Angeles County Arts for All initiative Alameda Countys Alliance for Arts Learning Leadership and Cultural Initiatives Silicon Valleys Creative Education Program in Santa Clara County There has also been substantial research in recent years documenting the characteristics and key quality indicators that need to be present in order for school districts to sustain quality arts programs In spite of broad public support strong existing policies and occasional positive developments dwindling state education funding combined with a new emphasis on accountability have ledhowever inadvertentlyto a narrowing of the curriculum and the exclusion of the arts for many students A Los Angeles Arts Commission study of the school districts in Los Angeles and a study of the Oakland Unified School District both indicate that arts courses are available only in a discrepant manner with lower performing students especially black and Latino students much less likely to have access to music and other arts programs while their wealthier or higher achieving peers are more likely to receive arts education as a matter of course Yet evidence suggests that consistent arts participation is an extremely effective way to engage studentsespecially high priority studentsand thus prevent dropouts What California schools need now is a systematic examination and promotion of public policy initiatives that will support quality arts education programs and enable implementation of sequential and comprehensive programs of study in dance music theatre and visual arts for each of Californias million public school students The

recognition of the arts as a core subject Existing policy such as the adoption of content standards is not however a guarantee that the arts will be taught uniformly throughout California schools Since California does not mandate a prescribed number of minutes of instruction in any subject other than physical education each local district uses discretion in deciding the extent to which each subject is taught Further without a state assessment and accountability system to drive instruction arts instruction is subject to the political will and budgetary constraints of each of the more than school districts in California This practice has resulted in a vastly uneven delivery system that undermines the intent of the content standards and existing Education Code statutes Despite broad public support and recent policy developments dwindling state education funding combined with a continuing emphasis on tested subjects have ledhowever inadvertentlyto a narrowing of the curriculum and

action as the prospect of inequality which denies a category of student access to arts education is unjust and may ultimately leave students inadequately prepared for the workforce Despite Californias reputation as an arts and cultural leader it lags behind many other states relative to statelevel arts education policy The State must direct local school boards to update their curriculum policies to

any childs educational training and experience In a state as diverse as California the arts are a cornerstone to achieving cultural literacy leading to shared understanding and tolerance of differences They also develop skills and abilities that are crucial for students entering into many vocational areas after high school The arts provide experiences in which students are encouraged to ask complex questions and experiment without a predetermined result A curriculum without the arts impoverishes our students as human beings citizens thinkers and workers in any field and narrows the

that the existing content standards in the Visual and Performing Arts are the foundation to preparation for this career path cid cid cid Dr Robert RootBernstein in a commentary published in the Los Angeles Times in states that The arts despite their reputation of being subjective emotional nonintellectual pursuits make science and invention possible Scientists and engineers need much more than objective languages of logic and mathematics to be creative They must learn to observe as acutely as artists and to visualize things in their minds as concretely They must learn to recognize and invent patterns like composers or poets to make models of their visions like sculptors and to manipulate the tools of their trade and play their hightech instruments with the same virtuosity of musical performers Harvard Business School professor John Kao in his book Jamming states that This is the age of creativity because the subtext of global competition is increasingly about a nations ability to mobilize its ideas talents and creative organizations A company that ignores the global creativity map is spurning an important set of strategic considerations p Professor of Regional Economic Development at Carnegie Mellon University Richard Florida states in his recent book The Rise of the Creative Class that Human creativity is the ultimate economic resource The ability to come up with new ideas and better ways of doing things is ultimately what raises productivity and thus living standardsthe previous shift substituted one set of physical inputs land and human labor for another raw materials and physical labor while the current one is based fundamentally on human intelligence knowledge and creativity pxiii California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg cid cid cid Florida also asserts that Given that creativity has emerged as the single most important resource of economic growth the best route to continued prosperity is by investing in our stock of creativity in all of its forms across the board It requires increasing investments in the multidimensional and varied forms of creativityarts music culture design and related fieldsbecause all are linked and flourish together p The US Labor Department report of the Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills SCANS recently cited the important role of arts education in achieving many core competencies for the workplace which include allocating resources collaborating acquiring and evaluating information and the understanding of social systems The arts are cited as important in certain foundational skills which include thinking creatively problemsolving exercising individual responsibility sociability and selfesteem cited in The Arts and Children Maryland Alliance for the Arts As Elliot Eisner Professor of Education and Professor of Art at Stanford University stated in a recent address While schools often emphasize practices that focus upon single correct answers life is not a multiple choice test In life ambiguities need to be addressed Alternatives need to be considered Judgments in the absence of rule need to be made Imagination needs to be called on Our inability to anticipate the catastrophe that was in spite of its many warnings has been described by our political leaders as a failure of imagination Isnt it ironic that the fields of work that most dramatically aim to develop imagination the arts should be so vulnerable when budgets are cut Children need to learn that for almost any problem there are often multiple solutions possibleand sometimes none at all To grasp multiple alternatives requires an act of the imagination In a testdriven school imagination is likely to be seen as a distraction We focus on answers when we need to be at least interested in telling questions p Given that creativity has emerged as the single most important resource of economic growth the best route to continued prosperity is by investing in our stock of creativity in all of its forms across the board Richard Florida Rise of the Creative Class Links Between the Arts and Economic Development Recent research by both national and regional agencies underscores that

the delivery of visual and performing arts instructional programs However most are not uniformly implemented across all school districts in California Further many of the Education Code laws define minimum standards without setting prescriptive accountability measures as California policymakers are reluctant to require new measures without the necessary funds to implement them ie unfunded mandates Instruction Arts education in California is mandated for pupils in grades through As stated in Section of the California Education Code the adopted course of study for grades to shall include instruction in visual and performing arts including dance music theatre and visual arts aimed at the development of aesthetic appreciation and the skills of creative expression Section of the California Education Code identifies a similar course of study for grades to Content Standards As mandated in Education Code Section the State Board of Education adopted voluntary content standards in dance music theatre and visual arts The Education Code does not require schools to follow content standards nor does it require assessment of pupils in the visual or performing arts The Code states that content standards are intended to provide a framework for programs that a school may offer The arts content standards are divided into five strands which include artistic perception creative expression historical and cultural context aesthetic valuing and connections relationships and applications Additionally State legislation mandates career technical education standards in the arts media and entertainment industry sector to be completed in Summer Graduation Requirement Currently the Education Code specifies that all students must complete one course in the arts or foreign language between grades to in order to satisfy the graduation requirement According to the policy database maintained by the Arts Education Partnership states now require the equivalent of full year in the visual and performing arts for all students Public University Admission Both the University of California and the California State University systems have instituted a oneyear freshman admissions requirement in visual or performing arts All high schools must provide a UC approved course in dance music theatre or visual arts so that all students will be eligible for admission to a California public university Teaching Credentials The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing issues single subject credentials in music and visual arts To teach dance or theatre an applicant must obtain a physical education or English single subject credential respectively As of January subject matter authorization credentials are available in art and music these credentials require coursework hours and provides NCLB compliancy Both of these credentials may be attached to Multiple Subject or Single Subject Credentials Teachers holding Multiple Subject or Standard Elementary Teaching Credentials may have art or music added to their credential as a supplementary subject matter authorization by verifying completion of specific Commission requirements Approved preservice programs require each prospective multiple subject teacher take coursework that enables them to identify the components and strands of arts education found in the Visual and Performing Arts Framework and Student Visual and Performing Arts Content Standards they must demonstrate a basic fluency in the elements of dance music theatre and visual arts and apply these elements and principles in order to create appropriate arts learning experiences with students At this time this typically translates as course in the visual and performing arts for preservice teachers The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing CCTC has recently completed development of a new series of subject matter examinations for prospective teachers who choose to meet the subject matter competence requirement for certification by taking examinations The examinations the California Subject Examinations for Teachers CSET are offered in most credential areas The examinations of the CSET reflect the recently revised K California Student Academic Content Standards As of fall all candidates who choose to meet the subject matter competence requirement by taking examinations must earn passing scores on the examinations of the CSET Questions relating to visual and performing arts are included in the California Subject Examinations for Teachers Visual and Performing Arts and NCLB The passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of lends federal support to the definition of the arts as a core subject According to Rod Paige former US Secretary of Education music and the arts should be considered core subjects in our nations schools There is absolutely no conflict between the expansion of our visual and performing arts programs and our music programs and our focus on other academic programs August NCLB is based on four basic principles stronger accountability for results increased flexibility and local control expanded options for parents and an emphasis on methods that have been proven to work The law does authorize a modest grant program in research model schoolbased arts education programs development of statewide tests inservice programs and unspecified collaborations among federal agencies arts and arts education associations However no substantive federal allocations exist for the delivery of arts instruction nationwide Further arts assessment scores do not count as a measure of Adequate Yearly Progress AYP a necessary measurement for all schools seeking federal education funds There is some perception that arts programs are especially vulnerable to cuts in the states with the lowest education budgets and in public schools where more of the students are at risk of academic failure In many cases arts education functions as a reward for higher achieving students As author Laura Chapman states Under NCLB the students who are most likely to have sustained and coherent [arts] instruction are also likely to be advantaged in many ways In the main these are already the students who benefit from arts education in schools p This trend is of particular concern in light of research evidence that high quality arts programs may be the very key to engaging the students most at risk California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg AAAARRRRTTTTSSSS AAAACCCCCCCCEEEESSSSSSSS How are the visual and performing arts being implemented in California schools This nations public education system is founded on the belief that all students have the right to a complete education free from geographic economic and social disparities Sadly as underscored by the recent Williams lawsuit the quality of public education in California schools does vary widely city by city region by region and often within the same school district Nowhere have these variations been more evident that in the availability and quality of instruction in the visual and performing arts Wide Variations in Access California state law does include the arts in the list of adopted courses of study see Appendix A The scope and breadth of any particular program is widely dependent however on whether or not that school or district has support from individual leaders in the district teachers principals superintendents school board parents and the community Variations in programmatic access are compounded at the elementary and middle school level since the high schools are more likely to offer visual and performing arts courses in compliance with the UCCSU admissions policies Treating the arts as a reward for good test scores or behavior relegating it to an extracurricular activity viewing the arts as enrichment or cutting the arts altogether is not uncommon at elementary and middle schools Music class enrollment did not

class enrollment did not represent the general school population in the categories of ethnicity bilingual status and California Standards Test CST proficiency levels Black and Latino students are underrepresented in middle school music classes while White and Asian students are overrepresented A Los Angeles County Arts Commission study entitled Arts in Focus revealed that most of the public school districts in Los Angeles County dedicated less than percent of their total budget to arts education The main finding of the report was that most children in the county received ad hoc exposure to the arts without any coherent sequential arts education The report also indicates that many schools would not have any arts education programming without the aid of parent organizations special fundraising and grants cid A Rand Corporation study entitled Arts Education Partnerships states that despite research linking arts education to desirable academic psychological cognitive developmental and social outcomes Deasy Fishek and despite widespread public support for arts education in schools across the country art education has most often been limited to merely exposing students to the arts rather than providing a substantial sequential curriculum comparable to other core subjects Access and Equity Issues Compounded in Schools in Lowincome Areas The elimination or atrophy of arts education in high priority schools deprives students of a visual and performing arts education while students in wealthier schools receive it as a matter of course cid In a report entitled Academic Atrophy the Council for Basic Education states In early a Council for Basic Education survey indicated that of principals had cut arts education and anticipated further reductions In highminority schools the numbers were higher at reporting decreases and anticipating more cuts in the near future Zastrow cid cid cid The report continues The possibility that minorities are more likely to experience a narrowing of the curriculum raises important questions of educational equity [we] must maintain a long term vision of what constitutes educational excellence one that both incorporates and moves well beyond literacy and numeracy Though we must certainly strive to close racial achievement gaps in mathematics and reading we run the risk of substituting one form of inequality for another ultimately denying our most vulnerable students the full liberal arts curriculum our most privileged youth receive as a matter of course While the need to boost poor and minority students mastery of foundational skills certainly justifies strong measures we still know far too little about the long term effects of a system that denies these students access to art education The prospect of two tiered curriculum liberal arts and visual and performing arts for the privileged and fundamental skills for the most vulnerable should create a stir Zastrow The Sound of Silence report from Music For All states that Many lowincome low performing elementary schools have curtailed or eliminated general music and in some cases instrumental music because of the demand placed on teachers and administrators by the state of California to increase Academic Performance Index scores Additionally elementary schools throughout the state have implemented literacy blocks which provide two or more mandatory hours of specialized instruction in reading andor math during which no other activities can take place The fact that many California school districts defer decisions regarding the offering of music instruction and other arts at the elementary level to individual elementary school sitebased management councilsexacerbates the problem Music for All Foundation In Curtain Call the National Education Associations Kristen Loschert asserts that The very students NCLB is most aimed at helpingthose who are lowincome minority and academically vulnerableare the ones studies consistently show

OConnell Arts education is a pivotal component of a complete education Ensuring access to the visual and performing arts must be a part of the educational offering for all California students At this juncture the challenge of ensuring all students have access to this quality instruction is largely fiscal in nature California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg While evident that arts education programs do rise and fall in tandem with the ups and downs of the budget many California schools have marginalized the arts since the s regardless of budget health Similarly the challenges in establishing arts programs predate No Child Left Behind and mandated testing That said however the combination of dwindling state monies for education the emphasis on standardized tests the relationship between those test scores and federal funds for schools and the fact that the arts are therefore not prioritized is a potentially deadly context for arts education According to a recent analysis by the Education Commission of the States of national press coverage of arts education issues There is the perception among arts education advocates that an increased focus on testing of core subjects such as math and reading have narrowed public school curricula While richer school districts can afford to maintain their arts program and poorer schools go without the inequality of students educational experiences is largely glossed over by the media Education Commission of the States in press In Art Education Linda Chapman reports a recent survey indicates that of parents of public school students and of the general public are concerned that an intense focus on tests in English and math will mean less emphasis on art music history and other subjects Rose Gallup In early states were considering legislation to refuse all NCLB funds or those for particular programs Manzo Several states have recently defined basic adequate or quality education to encompass studies of the arts NAEA Chapman In the same article Chapman predicts the proliferation of mandated tests in the next decade likely means that time for instruction will be reduced In elementary schools testpreparation and testtaking may well exceed the hours typically devoted to visual arts instruction in a year National Center for Education Statistics Chapman In establishing education prioritieswhich dictate budget allocations instructional strategies and timeschools often put the arts on the fringes of education Prescribed curricula prescribed teaching methods and prescribed time requirements for certain academic subjects have edged arts education out of the schedules of many students While it is not advisable to pit one subject area against another or to suggest that accountability measures are not important there is a basic inequity that must be addressed CCCCoooonnnncccclllluuuussssiiiioooonnnnssss aaaannnndddd RRRReeeeccccoooommmmmmmmeeeennnnddddaaaattttiiiioooonnnnssss The visual and performing arts provide crucial skills abilities and training that are not provided by any other core curricular subject The

their future intellectual social emotional creative and vocational success Employers most value critical thinking skills creativity and the ability to work well with others on a project teamall benefits of an education in the arts In order to ensure that the arts are taught in a way that will develop the skills and abilities that have been enumerated here there the State must enact new policies that support the implementation of each of the core curricular subjects not only those subject areas that are included in standardized tests It is clear that if a child has come from an economically deprived or emotionally chaotic environment the skills abilities and experiences provided through a substantive sequential arts curriculum are particularly beneficial to that childs eventual success in life and work The growing trend of educational inequity with regard to arts education in the public schools must be addressed and remedied through state action The State must direct local school boards to update their curriculum policies to be inclusive of adopted courses of study as defined by California Education Code A new Harris Poll released in June on the attitudes of Americans toward arts education revealed that percent of Americans agree that the arts are vital to providing a wellrounded education for children Additionally percent rated the importance of arts education a ten on a scale of one to ten Americans for the Arts The public supports arts education educators and researchers agree that the arts provide a critical link to learning and existing laws

California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg California Alliance for Arts Education artsedorg in Pre K education Such instruction shall also address diverse learning styles of all students inclusive of race culture religion socioeconomic factors and disability This also implies the importance of an understanding of the content and methodologies of arts education in the training of

One of the largest business sectors in the region Nearly million direct and indirect jobs in Los Angeles and Orange counties More than billion in state tax revenues generated Nearly billion in salesreceipts in Los Angeles County September This event is being held in conjunction with Arts for LA Annual Convergence Creativity Is Serious Business It is my pleasure to present the Report on the Creative Economy of the Los Angeles Region commissioned by Otis College of Art and Design from the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation It provides an update to the report which was the first of its kind to focus on the arts design and entertainment industries as a combined economic force in the Los Angeles and Orange Counties The response from the community to the report in was tremendous The data and analysis were widely used by cultural organizations foundations schools and public policy makers The message was out and the news was profound the creative sector is a major engine of the regional economy Once again the data show that the creative industries in Los Angeles encompass much more than simply entertainment And far from being a supporting player in our regional economy they generate nearly million jobs and over billion in sales revenues Otis is committed to conducting this study annually Our goal is to put real numbers to creativity and spotlight this underrecognized driver of the regional economy Our hope is that business cultural civic legislative philanthropic educational and community leaders gaining understanding of this important segment of the economy will join forces in fostering creativity as a sustaining force of our region An advocacy role for the creative economy is not traditional for an art school However Otis is not a conventional college of art and design Creativity and innovation are the vanguard of the st century As a key contributor to such forces Otis finds it natural to speak up for them The College understands that in todays world creative professionals have increasing social and economic opportunities and responsibilities In response Otis has embraced a unique educational and institutional approach to meeting the demands of the st century The mission of Otis is to prepare diverse and talented students to enrich our future Essential to their training is a conviction that art and design matter socially culturally and economically a commitment to community wellbeing on a local and global scale a hunger for experimentation and innovation and a connection to the real world Otis graduates are visionary practitioners equipped to redefine the role of artists and designers in society and in the creative economy As this report clearly demonstrates the Los Angeles region has an economically robust creative sector today Our ability to maintain this competitive edge depends on our ability to nurture creative education practices and industries with imagination and ambition This worthy goal can be accomplished by creating a collaborative network across sectors This deep and real commitment could ultimately brand the Los Angeles region as a leading creative region and be a catalyst for economic growth and expansion The Los Angeles region is fortunate in that we dont need to will creativity into being it is already a resource in our midst But it cannot be taken for granted Its persistence demands careful investment To be competitive in the world and in this age of ideas and innovation we must embrace creativity in our schools and in our workplaces We have the opportunity to combine creativity enterprise technology and public policy to tackle complex issues related to regional growth education community development and sustainability Let us imagine a creative future together Let us bring it

box The Los Angeles region has a creative culture The creative industries are undeniably important to the regional economy Nearly one million employees work directly or indirectly in the creative industries of Los Angeles and Orange counties Los Angeles County based firms in the industries generated nearly billion in revenues during while Orange County accounted for at least billion The state of California received more than billion in taxes tied to these industries How do the creative industries rank among other industry clusters in the region With employees in Los Angeles County creative industries would rank second behind tourism and hospitality jobs in and ahead of business and professional services jobs including architecture and engineering direct international trade jobs and entertainment jobs The creative industries in Orange County employ workers placing them sixth after tourism jobs business and professional services jobs including architecture and engineering wholesale tradelogistics jobs financial services jobs and technology jobs including computer system design In Otis College of Art and Design together with the LAEDC released the first ever comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of creative industries in Los Angeles County In this study the creative industries encompassed the following activities fashion toys product and industrial design architecture and interior design digital media communication arts art galleries visual and performing arts furniture and home furnishings and entertainment Data were collected on employment payrolls and revenuesshipments for all the component sectors in Los Angeles and Orange counties from the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics Calculations were made of indirect employment the overall economic impact and the state taxes generated by these industries using specific sector data from the RIMS II model created by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis The numbers were truly impressive The study is a revision and an update to the analysis carried out in The results are not comparable with the earlier study for several reasons The figures cited in the previous report for employment and payrolls were partially based on samples The figures in this report come directly from the California Employment Development Department and are based on tax payments that all firms are required to make into the state unemployment insurance fund These data are the best available for this type of information Note the Los Angeles County creative industries were topranked in LAEDCs previous report Their current status as number two does not reflect any change in their fortunes It is a result of changing data sources and new sector definitions used in the current report See text below for details of these changes Direct employees are the people working in the industry Indirect employees work for firms in the supplier industries and also for suppliers who sell goods and services to both the direct workers and the employees of the supplier firms In addition to using employment data from the state we surveyed local universities and colleges and trade and technical schools to learn how many faculty and staff are involved in their fine and performing arts programs These people were not counted in the previous report For Orange County complete information is not available on the sales shipments and receipts of several smaller creative industries at the current time The reason for this nondisclosure is the official policy of confidentiality The government does not want to publish any data that might allow knowledgeable persons to estimate the sales of any single firm This policy most affects the smaller industries Thus all of our statements about receipts in Orange County should be considered a lower bound The actual figures are surely higher than shown Also in this report we have changed the definitions of some industries to better reflect their activities The effect on the numbers was mixed with some going up while others declined Many creative people are not employed in a traditional way which complicates our analytical effort Because they are selfemployed they are not captured by the usual government information sources We obtained information from a nontraditional source on this significant group of people in the twocounty area data are on page The creative industries have important linkages to the top two traditional industries in Southern California The first is international trade The import containers handled at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are often filled with goods designed in the region and produced in Asia The sorting and further processing of these goods takes place in warehouse and distribution space giving the creative industries a real estate impact In Los Angeles County this activity has resulted in a tight industrial real estate market with the first half of vacancy rate at just This need for space has spilled over into the RiversideSan Bernardino area which had a first half of industrial vacancy rate of The second key linkage is to the tourism industry Visitors come to Los Angeles to experience the lifestyles and attitudes presented by the entertainment industry They also come to shop for items that carry the LA brand The creative industries are among the top employees in the Los Angeles region Just as important the creative talent pool in the region isnt that vulnerable to going offshore It is the combination of place resources and open attitudes towards new ideas that makes Los Angeles unique Why did we do this study Too often people dismiss creative activities as a frill They are not In the Los Angeles region creativity is serious business Otis College of Art and Design commissioned this analysis to put real numbers to the business of creativity Employment In more than people in Los Angeles County worked directly in the creative industries While many would expect the entertainment industry to dominate it did not It accounted for just of the creative jobs By sector in the largest employment counts were found in entertainment jobs fashion jobs furniturehome furnishings jobs and fine arts providers jobs See Table on page for the sector details But direct employment is only the beginning Every job in the creative industries supports or sustains other indirect jobs in the area Direct employees are those who actually work in the creative industries of Los Angeles and Orange counties Indirect employment is created when firms in these industries make purchases from their suppliers and vendors Additional indirect jobs are generated when the direct and indirect workers spend their wages on consumer goods and services Direct and indirect employment in the creative industries based in Los Angeles County on a fulltime equivalent FTE basis totaled nearly jobs in This fact points to another aspect of the creative industries they have a highmultiplier impact That is each direct job supports roughly indirect jobs In Orange County the creative industries were responsible for direct jobs in The largest employment sector was fashion with jobs followed by furniture with jobs and architecture and interior design with jobs Direct and indirect employment in the creative industries located in Orange County totaled jobs based on fulltime equivalent employment The multiplier effect in this county is a little smaller than in Los Angeles at indirect jobs for every direct job Some comparisons help put these employment numbers in perspective There are more direct jobs in the creative industries of Los Angeles and Orange Counties than All nonfarm employment in the Tucson Arizona metro area jobs and All nonfarm employment in the state of North Dakota jobs Direct and indirect employment in the creative industries of Los Angeles and Orange counties accounted for more than of total nonfarm employment in the two counties All

Dept ES data indirect impacts estimated by LAEDC Nonemployer Creative Activity Many people in creative activities work as nonemployer firms or firms with revenues but no paid direct employees Thus they do not show up in the traditional federal and state government employment data such as the ES reports used to develop the job numbers in this report The latest nonemployer data come from the IRS and cover tax year It should also be noted that some people may have a tax ID number as a nonemployer firm while also working for a traditional company The latter job will be covered in the traditional statistics To prevent doublecounting we treat this data separately from the ES based data Note also that there are no nonemployer data for digital media and several other industries In there were creative nonemployer firms in Los Angeles County and in Orange County Since there has been steady growth in both counties By far the largest number of these firms is in the sector called independent artists writers and performers Revenuesreceipts of creative nonemployer firms in Los Angeles County were nearly billion in with generated by independent artists writers and performers In

The creative industries of the Los Angeles area have significant potential for further growth The recent flat employment trends reflect industryspecific issues such as those found in apparel and furniture Employment in these two sectors declined by nearly a quarter between and because more production runs now take place in Asia Excluding manufacturing of apparel and furniture employment in the creative industries increased by jobs or by between and However the creative industries do face some issues These include cid A lack of recognition in the region of how important these activities are A key driver of the regions economy the creative sector is a serious business generating good quality jobs and significant tax revenue streams cid One result of these attitudes is that many of the creative industries are ignored by government agencies in planning and support cid A lack of arts and designrelated education in the K curriculum There is a huge irony here because at the college and university level the creative educational assets of the Los Angeles area are unparalleled In addition graduates of arts programs can move to and thrive in other fields of endeavor cid There is vast untapped potential in partnerships between colleges and university programs and the business community that promote innovation and the creative economy Both sectors could reach out to each other more effectively cid The regions creative talent pool which is unique is not fully used in the areas economic development efforts Business and government leaders should consider how to utilize the regions creative assets more effectively With the data in this report it is clear that the creative industries can be used to brand Southern California Resolving all the issues will be timeconsuming and require a collective will among various sectors But the efforts will be worthwhile as creativity in Los Angeles already generates a huge number of jobs and tax flows with little or no encouragement

Division to help bring the arts directly to the schools Having grown up with little exposure to music she hopes that she can change the landscape for most of our students She believes that with strong

prefaced her presentation by providing a testimony on how her sons involvement in the school band has enabled him to overcome his Committee of the Whole Notes personal challenges and has contributed to his success in school and now as an adult in the military The start of the turnaround in her school can be attributed to the arts Even with their beautification efforts and the addition of th grade the parents and community were still clamoring for more in the area of an arts program In order to encourage parents not to look into magnets charter schools or private schools Ms Harris and her team built up the schools choral music program The group steadily increased in numbers as students began enjoying the benefits of learning songs and harmonies under music teacher Ms Cronan In through the Arts program the school gained one credentialed teacher each for dance theater and visual arts With no new core teachers and the improvement in their music and orchestral program they saw the positive effect on attendance with families returning to their neighborhood school That year their API shot up points Ms Harris believes that with the strong collaboration among stakeholders it is possible to turnaround a PI school to one which is now a candidate to be a California Distinguished School The mission is to ensure that students meet the AG requirements with the F for visual as a core subject

responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and supervisory responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter

please call me at or email me at josecolegutierrezlausdnet c James Morris Judy Elliott David Holmquist Jerry Thornton Jefferson Crain Barack H Obama Leadership Academy Charter Petition Findings of Fact January The charter review process requires the authorizer to evaluate whether the charter petition meets the criteria for approval Education Code Section b states the required petition elements and conditions for denial Education Code Section outlines additional petition criteria The Petition of Barack H Obama Leadership Academy BHOLA or charter school does not meet the criteria under Education Code section b Education Code section b states A school district governing board shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice Education code section b provides that the governing board shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements LAUSDs analysis of the charter petition resubmitted on or about November to LAUSD by BHOLA indicates Regarding above The petition does not provide a sound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school At the present time the charter school has not provided any written documentation to demonstrate that it will have membership in a SELPA in time to commence operation for the start of the school year resulting in the charter schools inabilityfailure to provide a sound education program to the students it will serve Regarding above The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition and the charter school materials submitted with the petition contain numerous mistakes inaccuracies inconsistencies and incompleteness including reference to noncontrolling outofstate authority in support of its procedures inconsistentinaccurate identification of the charter school inconsistent identification of the grade levels served contradictory statements regarding the provision of student transportation and other evidence of the petitioners failure to review content which was obviously cutandpasted from one or more other sources These inconsistencies result in mistaken interpretations confusion lack of clarity andor make portions of the petition impossible to assess properly The number and type of errors and mistakes in the petition and supporting materials and the overall quality of the petition not only cause LAUSD concern with regard to the care that was used in preparing this document which is intended to control the development and operation of the charter school but also call into question the qualifications or experience of those proposing to open and operate the charter school This concern is exacerbated by the fact that this was not the first time the petitioners have submitted a charter petition to a California school district In fact the petitioners recently submitted a charter petition to the Orange Unified School District on or about November which was rejected by the Orange Unified School Districts Board With the submission of this recent petition for the establishment of a charter school the petitioners should be wellaware of what must be contained in a charter petition for the document to be legally sufficient The petitioners past history of involvement in charter schools has been unsuccessful Petitioners have submitted multiple petitions for the establishment of a charter school that were considered and denied by local educational agencies including the following Orange Unified School District petition denied December Kern High School District petition denied December At the present time the charter school has not provided any written documentation to demonstrate that it will have membership in a SELPA in time to commence operation for the start of the school year resulting in the charter schools inabilityfailure to provide a sound education program to the students it will serve The charter schools budget plan does not reconcile with the charter schools anticipated cash flow Additionally the Revenue Limit Sources relied upon by the charter school in its startup Budget Plan and Cash Flow Statement as sources of funds are not available to the charter school for its startup operations The petitioners have failed to provide documentation and benchmarks for when the funds from a line of credit up to fundraising activities and the Walton Grant will be available to the charter school Such funds represent a significant portion of the charter schools budget The charter schools Budget Plan and Cash Flow Statements fail to budget for professionalconsulting services auditlegal and fiscalfinancial positions for the five year term of the charter and the charter schools budgeted expenditures for items including insurance communications utilities and custodial services are understated These budget shortfalls may result in a deficit budget for the charter school impacting its ability to successfully operate its education program Regarding above The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code section BHOLA fails to consistently affirm in the petition that BHOLA shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education Code section which includes disability gender nationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section of the Penal Code The petition fails to sufficiently affirm that BHOLA will admit all students who wish to attend The petition fails to affirm that in the event a public random drawing is implemented admission preference will be extended to students currently attending the charter school and students who reside within LAUSD The petition fails to include the required affirmation regarding notice to the superintendent of the school district of a students last known

lifelong learners The petition fails to include a brief narrative describing a typical day at the charter school or to include a sufficient sample daily schedule explaining the rationale for allocation of instructional time to different subject matter areas For instance the petition fails to provide separate daily schedules for high school students that depict how classes are aligned for each grade level and the time at which they will occur Additionally the petition fails to include examples for daily schedules that address for example shortened days pupil free days and professional development days The petition fails to include the charter schools academic calendar The petition includes an underdeveloped framework for instructional design that is not aligned with the needs of

petition fails to include the scope and sequence of skills to be taught across the grade levels and the different subjects the school plans to teach The petition fails to provide information on how

the curriculum nor is there any clear indication that the curriculum to be used is state adopted or researched The petition fails to include any information regarding the textbooks or other instructional resources to be used by the charter school The petition fails to clearly describe the charter schools basic learning environment For instance the petition fails to provide additional

without providing additional information The petition fails to include a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools obligations to students with special education needs in accordance

conform with procedures which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate The Petition fails to address how the charter school will meet the needs of English Language Learner students The petition fails to address how the charter school will meet the needs of gifted students and students achieving substantially above grade level The petition fails to address how the charter school will meet the needs of students achieving substantially below grade level expectations The petition fails to address how the charter school will meet the needs of students of low socioeconomic status The petition fails to sufficiently describe how the charter school will recruit teachers who are qualified to deliver the proposed instructional program The petition fails to sufficiently describe how the charter school will provide ongoing professional development to ensure that teachers have the skills to deliver the proposed instructional program Measurable Pupil Outcomes Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of measurable pupil outcomes The petition fails to specify the skills knowledge and attitudes that reflect the charter schools educational objectives and can be assessed at a minimum by objective means that are frequent and sufficiently detailed enough to determine whether pupils are making satisfactory progress The petition fails to specify the frequency of objective means of measuring pupil outcomes vary according to such factors as grade level subject matter the outcome of previous objective measurements and information that may be collected from anecdotal sources The petition fails to include the proposed charter schools Academic Performance Index growth target The petition fails to include the proposed charter schools Adequate Yearly Progress target The petition fails to include the proposed charter schools California Standards Test target The petition fails to include the proposed charter schools CAHSEE target Methods to

will grant authority to the state of California to provide a copy of all test results directly to the District and the charter school Governance Structure Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools governance structure The petition fails to include evidence that the organizational and technical designs of the charter schools governance structure reflects a seriousness of purpose necessary to ensure that there will be active and effective representation of interested parties including but not limited to parentsguardians While the petition mentions a parent advisory council it fails to describe the council or address the process andor procedures for integrating parent representation at the proposed charter school by means of the parent advisory counsel or otherwise The petition fails to provide sufficient assurance that BHOLA will comply with the Brown Act While the petition specifies that the charter school will comply with the provisions of the Brown Act the Dual Diagnosis Assessment and Treatment Center Incs Board of Trustees Bylaws allow the corporate Board to operate in a manner which may conflict with the Brown Act Also the petition fails to specify how often the charter schools governing board will meet and the manner for posting meeting notices distributing agendas and recording governing board actions calling into question whether the petitioners understand what is required in order to comply with the Brown Act The petition fails to provide assurance that BHOLA will comply with the laws against conflicts of interest This is of particular concern considering at least two of the three charter schools current Board of Trustee members may have a conflict of interest arising out of the charter schools contract with an educational management company for services Specifically the chief executive officer of the management company Edna Miller is the niece of Trustee Joseph Smith and the chief financial officer of the management company David McGuire is the son of Trustee Shahida Wynne Additionally while no familial relationship exists both Edna Miller and David McGuire are described as colleagues of Trustee Joseph Turner Information about the charter schools partnership with Buckingham University is not sufficiently described by the charter school This lack of information causes concern for LAUSD considering three individuals who have been identified by the charter school as members of the charter schools Advisory Board are currently on the Board of Trustees for Buckingham University Specifically Kenneth Orduna Willie Dye and Mervyn Dymally are all Trustees for Buckingham University Furthermore Mr Dymally is the President of the University LAUSDs concern is compounded by the fact that the petition fails to describe the functionsauthority of the Advisory Board The petition references a parent advisory council community advisory committee and governance council but does not include these bodies in its organizational chart submitted with the petition or provide any information regarding the roles and responsibilities of these bodies and their functions related to the governance and operation of the charter school Employee Qualifications Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of employee qualifications The petition fails to identify the general qualifications for the various categories of employees the school anticipates to be employed by the charter school The petition only discusses teachers and not eg administrative instructional support noninstructional support staff qualifications The petition fails to identify those positions that the charter school regards as key in each school employee category and fails to specify the additional qualifications expected of individuals assigned to those positions While the petition does specify that it will require charter school teachers to hold a Credentialing certificate permit or other document equivalent to that which a teacher in other public schools would be required to hold and that these documents shall be maintained by the charter school it fails to provide an assurance that the charter school will maintain current copies of all teacher credentials and that they be readily available for inspection Additionally the petition fails to describe procedures it will follow for monitoring teacher credentials The petition fails to properly acknowledge that the charter schools employee selection procedures shall not discriminate against applicants

sexual orientation or any other basis protected by federal state or local law or ordinance or regulation The petition fails to sufficiently describe the charter schools employee hiring and evaluation procedures For instance the petition states that the Governing Board development team andor administrative staff will be responsible for selecting employees for the school however the petition fails

identified in the petition Health and Safety Procedures Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools health and safety procedures The petition

Response Act AHERA CFR part The petition fails to specify the charter schools insurance requirements in a manner which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate The petition fails to acknowledge the charter schools obligations to indemnify LAUSD in a manner which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate The charter schools Student Parent Handbook references several nonbinding outof state statutes to support school procedures including school visitors possession of alcoholic beverages on school grounds and student use of alcohol and controlled substances calling into question whether the charter school will effectively ensure the safety of pupils and staff Means to Achieve a Reflective Racial and Ethnic Balance Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of means for achieving racial and ethic balance The petition fails to sufficiently describe the charter schools annual outreach efforts for achieving and maintaining a racial and ethnic balance among its students that is reflective of the general population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of LAUSD including what geographic areas will be

executed the timelines under which the open enrollment period and lottery will occur the location where the lottery will occur and the efforts the school will undertake to ensure all interested parties may observe the lottery the date and time lotteries will occur so most interested parties will be able to attend the means by which the school will contact the parentsguardians of students who

health service center for atrisk students and yet there is no discussion in the course descriptions as to how the selfpacing or project based nature of the courses will occur The petition discusses technological sophistication as key component for being an educated person and states that the school will have a hightech computer labp but does not provide details for how any of this or other

number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements LAUSDs analysis of the charter petition resubmitted on or about October to LAUSD by ECMS indicates Regarding above The petition does not provide a sound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school At the present time the charter school has not provided any written documentation to demonstrate that it will have membership in a SELPA in time to commence operation for the start of the school year resulting in the charter schools inabilityfailure to provide a sound education program to the students it will serve Regarding above The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition At the present time the charter school has not provided any written documentation to demonstrate that it will have membership in a SELPA in time to commence operation for the start of the school year resulting in the charter schools inabilityfailure to provide a sound education program to the students it will serve A current Environmental Charter Schools board member who the petition describes as the instructional expert serving on the board has a past history of involvement in a charter school which LAUSD determined to be unsuccessful This board member was the developer and executive director of the Southern California Academy of Arts and Sciences SCAAS a charter school revoked by the LAUSD Board on May for reasons including violation of building safety and other laws numerous material violations of its charter and falsification of student attendance registers The petitioners have failed to provide sufficient evidence that they will be able to secure the total Walton Family Foundation grant which represents a significant portion of the charter schools budget While the petition does specify that the charter school has already established funding for startup and advance funding for facilities in the event grant funding is not secured it fails to provide any documentation or other proof to support this assertion Given that this is the fourth th time the petitioners have submitted their petition to LAUSD to establish this charter school LAUSD would expect elements to be legally sufficient and to have addressed all the concerns raised by LAUSD during prior submissions The fact that deficiencies still remain causes concern with regard to the care that was used in preparing the document which is intended to control the development and operation of the charter school and calls into question the qualifications and experience of those proposing to open and operate the charter school Regarding above The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code section ECMS fails to consistently affirm in the petition that ECMS shall not discriminate against any pupil on the basis of the characteristics listed in Education Code section which includes disability gender nationality race or ethnicity religion sexual orientation or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes set forth in Section of the Penal Code The petition fails to sufficiently affirm that ECMS will admit all students who wish to attend The affirmation in the petition regarding what preferences will be extended by ECMS when the

description of all of the elements required in EC b based on the following findings of fact Description of the Schools Educational Program Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools educational program The petition fails to include a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools obligations to students with special

important role in informing the Boards decision making process and serves a central function to the successful operation of the charter school Additionally the Parent Institute for Quality Education PIQE an organization with which ECMS will partner with to provide assistance to parents of students attending the charter school is not represented on the organizational chart The petition fails to describe the terms of the parent contract which outlines the responsibilities of parents and expectations of ECMS for parents as volunteers making it impossible for LAUSD to evaluate whether such terms create an over burdensome obligation for someall parents which may result in a discriminatory impact on those parents and a resulting denial of admission to all who wish to attend the charter school The petition fails to provide sufficient assurance that ECMS will comply with the Brown Act While the petition specifies that the charter school will comply with the provisions of the Brown Act and that the ECS bylaws shall not conflict with the charter the ECS Bylaws allow the corporate Board to operate in a manner which may conflict with the Brown Act The petition fails to provide sufficient assurance that ECMS will comply with the laws against conflicts of interest While the petition specifies that the charter school will comply with conflict of interest laws that apply to all public entities per Government Code section the Bylaws of ECS that operates the charter school allows up to of the Board of Directors to be interested persons which may conflict with the restrictions of Government Code section et seq Similarly the Bylaws allow ECS to engage in transactions in which a director has a material financial interest For the first two to five years of the charter ECS will charge ECMS a fee that is equivalent to of the charter schools general apportionment and categorical revenue as payment for leadership and instructional support services Not only does the petition fail to describe the scope of such services but since ECS is the corporate entity that operates ECMS the charter schools intended arrangement allows ECS to unscrupulously pay itself for the provision of services which it is already obligated to provide as the entity responsible for the operation of the charter school The petition fails to sufficiently acknowledge that ECMS will comply with District policy related to charter schools The petition fails to sufficiently describe the commingling of responsibilities and the fiscal relationship between the ECMS and Environmental Charter High

section The petition fails to include a sufficient assurance that ECMS will require its employees to furnish ECMS with a criminal background check summary as required by Education Code section The petition content regarding charter schools facilities is not sufficiently comprehensive to ensure the health and safety of charter schools students and staff The petition fails to specify that ECMS will comply with the Healthy Schools Act which details pest management requirements for schools The petition improperly qualifies specific provisions related to charter school insurance requirements which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate Means to Achieve a Reflective Racial and Ethnic Balance Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of means for achieving racial and ethic balance The petition fails to sufficiently describe the charter schools annual outreach efforts for achieving and maintaining a racial and ethnic balance among its

time lotteries will occur so most interested parties will be able to attend the means by which the school will contact the parentsguardians of students who have been promoted off the waiting list and timelines under which parentsguardians must respond in order to secure admission and the records the school will keep on file to document the fair execution of lottery procedures The admission preferences set forth in the petition do not comply with Education Code section dB and are unacceptable Education Code section d provides that when the number of students who wish to attend a charter school exceeds the schools capacity attendance shall be determined by a random drawing and preference shall be extended to pupils currently attending the charter school and pupils who reside in the district except as provided for in Section Additional preferences may be permitted by the chartering authority on an individual school basis and only if consistent with law The petition fails to fails

suspendedrecommended for expulsion and it does not sufficiently address student suspension and expulsion appeal rights The petition fails to sufficiently describe the discipline policies that will be in place at ECMS necessary to afford students adequate due process For instance the petition fails to define the meaning of specific behaviors that are prohibited and fails to define other terms that are part of the charter schools disciplinary process Additionally the petition fails to sufficiently identify those charter school staff with authorityresponsibility for the various levels of discipline process demonstrating the petitioners lack of due consideration as to who is involved in and makes disciplinary decisions so that parentsguardians and students are afforded adequate due process regarding disciplinary matters by means of fair impartial decision makers The petition fails to provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the procedures regarding an informal conference related to suspension of a student For instance the Petition fails to describe the process by which parents will be notified of their childs suspension Additionally the petitions use of as

afforded adequate due process The petition fails to provide a reasonably comprehensive description of its student expulsion procedures For instance the petition fails to describe expulsion conference procedures so that students and parents are afforded the right to have an opportunity to know the charges and to provide an explanation in their defense The petition also fails to sufficiently describe what needs to be included in a written notice to expel and to specify what the time frame for sending the notice is The Petition fails to include in its list of grounds for discipline two commonly occurring misconducts bullying and aiding and abetting the infliction of physical injury Without including these offenses in its disciplinary policy the charter schools students may not be held accountable for their commission of such offenses and the safety of students staff and visitors to the school may be jeopardized The petition fails to demonstrate an understanding of the rights

employees in accordance with current collective bargaining agreements Dispute Resolution Procedures Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of dispute resolution procedures The dispute resolution procedures described in the petition fail to conform with procedures which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate The petition incorrectly references GCS related to parentstudent grievance procedures Assuming the petitioners meant the petition to refer to ECMS even though the petition specifies that all studentparent grievance processes and procedures will be detailed in the charter schools StudentParent Handbook the procedures provided in the Handbook are those of LAUSD and even though the charter school indicates that it has adopted the LAUSD policy it fails to tailor the policy to be specifically applicable to ECMS calling into question whether ECMS comprehends and will implement what the procedures entail Closure Procedures

will utilize a constructivist approach where students generate questions thereby facilitating authentic inquiry Students become inquirers when their natural curiosity has been nurtured They have acquired the skills necessary to conduct purposeful constructive research They actively enjoy learning and their love of learning will be sustained throughout their lives This philosophy is promoted by a commitment to structured inquiry as a leading vehiclepedagogical approach for learning Inquiry is defined as a process initiated by the learner or the teacher who moves the learner from his or her current level of understanding to a new and deeper level of understanding ECMS recognizes many forms of inquiry based on young adolescents genuine curiosity and on their wanting and needing to know more about the world These include exploring wondering and questioning experimenting and playing with possibilities researching and seeking information collecting data and reporting findings etc This process of inquiry nurtures students innate curiosity and promotes a love of learning It is authentically individualized and permits students to develop deeper and more extensive projects according to their individual capacity The teacher will nurture and stimulate further the students natural curiosity by being a careful and thoughtful participant and a monitor of the exploration and investigation the children engage in or initiate and by stimulating their curiosity and inquiry through the presentation of surprises C The petition includes narrative describing a typical day at the

Middle School ELEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM Introduction Environmental Charter Middle School ECMS has been developed to respond to the unique developmental and learning needs of middle school students It does not simply intend to prepare its students for the next level but to nurture support and challenge its students so that they might continue their healthy physical cognitiveintellectual moral psychological and socialemotional development ECMSs basic philosophy draws upon the ecology principle of The deeper the roots the higher the reach While extensive research into best practices at high performing middle schools has contributed to the design of ECMS the schools organizational and programmatic design is essentially based on meeting the developmental needs of young adolescents so that they may maximize their own learning potential As the National Middle School Association noted in a position paper With young adolescents achieving academic success is highly dependent upon their other developmental needs also being met The founders of ECMS believe that careful attention to preparing a unique learning environment that addresses the particular developmental needs of young adolescents will lead to significant learning outcomes ECMS has been founded and developed by a team of educators from high performing charter schools in Southern California such as Environmental Charter High School ECHS an independent charter high school in Lawndale serving students primarily from Lawndale Hawthorne and Gardena since ECMS will benefit greatly from the experience and expertise developed by the faculty and staff of ECHS and the two schools will collaborate in many aspects including professional development common community partnerships and administrative support ECMSs student demographics are expected to mirror those of the student population at ECHS which in served a population comprised of the following raceethnicities Latino AfricanAmerican Asian Caucasian Other of the students qualified for Free or Reduced Lunch were identified as English Language Learners and had Special Education IEPs The operators of ECMS will be able to leverage this experience of serving a neighboring community and similar student population as key personnel from ECHS will serve ECMS in a leadership and advising capacity See Element for a detailed description of roles and responsibilities of personnel Core Values and Vision National Middle School Association This We Believe Successful Schools for Young Adolescents pg Environmental Charter Middle School Environmental

Responsibility beginning with the individual and extending to the classroom campus community and world and o Environmentally Sustainable Practices that utilize systems thinking and wisely manage resources for today and tomorrow At Environmental Charter Middle School our vision is to create a school that is alive When someone steps onto the campus for the first time they will feel the positive energy and intellectual curiosity that is the driving force of the ECMS community Teachers act as facilitators of inquiry seeking realworld examples and unique handson learning opportunities that bring the subject matter to life for their students By creating these learning experiences teachers give students a bigger window to see what is possible for their future The campus will feel very different than other schools The schools physical environment the classrooms the buildings and the grounds will act as a teaching tool that connects students to the world around them The school will be known in the community as a safe vibrant and intellectually challenging place to learn and grow and will be supported by highlevels of active community involvement Students will be highly regarded as assets to the community due to their numerous service projects and collaborations with community partners Each year of ECMSs students who go onto attend an ECS high school and graduate will be admitted to four year collegesuniversities and our graduates will thrive at their chosen post graduate learning institutions Our alumni will be sought after by colleges universities and employers for their knowledge of the world and how it works for their collaborative and critical thinking skills and for their highly developed sense of purpose Because of the success of its programs ECMS will be viewed as a National model of educational excellence evidenced by hundreds of educators seeking to replicate our educational model at their schools through the ECS Best Practices Lab Environmental Charter Middle School Students to Be Served ECMSs educational program is designed for students to develop the skills knowledge and attitudes that prepare them for success in high school college preparatory courses as well as prepare them to be effective stewards of their community ECMS seeks to attract families that share the schools core beliefs about how learning best occurs including

knowledge and skills to succeed in a college preparatory program to inspire them to discover their own sense of purpose and to empower them to become quality stewards of their community and world The curriculum will have traditional subjects with an integrated approach that will address rigorous academic concepts in an authentic interdisciplinary manner Students will also take specialty subject courses to support their academic social and physical development including AVID Advancement Via Individual Determination Games and Movement physical education Arts and Handwork and Green Tribes an environmental education and leadership sequence Environmental service learning projects will empower students to utilize their skills and energy to help solve our communitys most pressing environmental issues Our students find it particularly important that they become leaders in environmental causes because their community is largely underrepresented in the environmental movement and their community and others like it tends to be most detrimentally affected by environmental problems such as tainted water carcinogenic air and the health problems that derive from these problems This fact adds a greater sense of purpose and motivation to our students who embrace these issues on a personal intellectual and moral level Environmental Charter Middle School A main aim of the school is to utilize innovative teaching methods and a unique setting to foster in its students a genuine sense of belonging enthusiasm and selfconfidence based on measurable achievement and performance against high rigorous standards as well as on contributions to the community ECMS will encourage the participation of the entire family in the education process and emphasize the importance of a pledge to lifelong learning With a strong commitment to providing an educational setting that will benefit children at all points of the ability spectrum the school will encourage cooperation and a strong sense of community while fostering respect for racial ethnic and economic diversity All students inherit the exciting opportunity as well as the great responsibility of shaping our future ECMS believes that welleducated socially aware and personally responsible children will create a better society for us all because they will continue to be contributing caring citizens as adults Empowered to be leaders well into the next century ECMS students will subtly but profoundly come to appreciate a very special place the natural landscape of their youth Guiding Principles A strong community is essential to learning How this is lived at ECMS Small school students at full capacity Small classes Average class size of Looping Teachers stay with students for their first two years to ensure that students are known well and that their learning needs are met Advisory Students are assigned an advisor who stays with them for all three years The advisor who is also one of the students core teachers in grades and serves as the main liaison between the school and the students family maintaining regular communication between home and school In addition to ample contact in core and specialty courses the advisor meets with students at least daily to ensure that each student has at least one adult on campus who knows them and their parents well Social Emotional Learning Communitybuilding activities are built into the curriculum to allow students to learn and practice the skills they need to work with others in a collaborative community Community Building Practices class plays team challenges teambuilding activities group field studies projectbased learning group tutorial sessions differentiated instruction All members are valued and no one is left out Response to Intervention Strategy

resources that strengthen the community Family members are included in school celebrations and provide a cultural context for learning Teachers and staff members are trained in methods to ensure that each member of the learning community feels safe and respected regardless of background education level language spoken religion etc The whole person is valued How this is lived at ECMS Developmentally appropriate curriculum and structures Curricular themes are targeted at topics of interest to middle school students such as revolution discovery and justice The daily schedule is designed to meet the academic and social needs of students allowing time for play collaboration and reflection Social Emotional Learning Specially designed activities from the Tribes Program are embedded in the curriculum to address the socialemotional learning needs of middle school students All teachers are trained in the successful implementation of the program in their classes and the school as a whole Specialty Subject Courses Four strands of specialty subjects arts and handwork games and movement Green Tribes and AVID address the whole person in a variety of ways Through these courses students will use their brains and bodies in concert to practice physical movements fine motor skills artistic endeavors service projects and creative problem solving Students will be exposed to numerous experiences that will help each student to discover their own and others strengths passions and purpose Multimodal Instruction All teachers will be trained in multimodal methods of learning to address the diverse learning needs of students and to allow students to discover their own best ways of learning and modes with which they struggle Learning how to cope and persevere through challenging situations and to safely move out of ones comfort zone are valuable learning experiences that help to build character and selfesteem Integrated Curriculum The curriculum at ECMS recognizes that the world around us is by nature interdisciplinary Units of instruction are designed around thematic questions that challenge students to explore possible answers to the questions through a variety of Environmental Charter Middle School disciplines including the arts This allows for a much more authentic and deeper exploration than traditional departmentalized learning and enables the learner to interact with the content from a variety of access points thus improving comprehension Arts Integration Teachers integrate the arts into instruction developing the creativity of students and ensuring that learning is multimodal and engaging Service Learning Students will participate in at least two major service learning projects per year The projects allow students to apply their skills and knowledge to serve others or a cause greater than themselves This addresses a core developmental need of young adolescents brings a sense of purpose to the academic work and builds community Professional Learning Communities At ECMS the whole teacher is also nurtured by supporting the teacher to be the most effective teacher he or she can be This is grounded in the belief that the teacher is a learner and facilitated through strong Professional Learning Communities that are supported with time training leadership and resources Professional development sessions and regular staff meetings include team building activities collaborative problemsolving activities opportunities to explore ones creative and artistic sides and ample time for reflection Parent Education ECMS recognizes that parents of young adolescents have unique needs and aims to support those needs through a responsive parent education program In collaboration with administration the Parent Council will support parents at ECMS This group meets once a month and provides parents with a forum to share concerns and to problem solve collaboratively Parents also identify specific topics of interest and the schools administration facilitates speakers on the identified topics At ECHS examples of past parent education topics include family nutrition effective family communication socialemotional concerns and how to establish an effective learning environment at home Reflection Through the socialemotional curriculum and advisory program reflection is part of the daily routine at ECMS for students and teachers Daily journal writing class councils closing sessions and independent work time allow for students and teachers to process and make sense of all the new experiences and ideas that one is confronted with This helps to prevent a feeling of being overwhelmed and helps one to stay focused and balanced Instruction and assessment are most effective when they actively involve the learner How this is lived at ECMS Projectbased learning ECMS students learn to apply skills and knowledge to solve real world problems For example rather than just reading about how the nutrients in soil help plants to grow students will actually grow plants in the school garden test the nutrient levels in the soil explore different outcomes in different growing environments reflect on their findings and present their findings in both written and oral presentations Service Learning Students will participate in at least two major service learning projects per year The projects allow students to apply their skills and knowledge to serve others Environmental Charter Middle School or a cause greater than themselves This addresses a core developmental need of young adolescents brings a sense of purpose to the academic work and builds community Examples of Service Learning projects include teaching younger students about environmental problems and what they can do to help solve the problem presenting data to local lawmakers and business leaders about environmentally detrimental practices or working with local scientists to collect sand samples to measure the levels of pollution on local beaches Professional Learning Communities At ECMS teachers are active learners as well All teachers will be trained in the PLC methodology of collaboratively improving their practice through the analysis of student work and performance data This method allows the teacher to actively reflect on his or her practice and to take the lead in the ongoing improvement of that practice Community of Learners ECMS students will not only be challenged and supported to maximize their learning by their teachers but they will also be supported and challenged by their peers ECMS students will learn how to provide meaningful feedback and constructive criticism of their peers work in a respectful manner This level of collaboration is only possible in an environment that actively promotes respect and trust and values each and every member as unique and valuable Higher Order Thinking Units of instruction will be carefully scaffolded to facilitate students progression of thinking from the passive to the active While all teachers will utilize the concepts of Blooms Taxonomy of Educational Objectives students will have dedicated time for cognitive and affective skill development through their AVID class and psychomotor skill development through Games and Movement and Arts and Handwork classes Over time students will demonstrate analysis synthesis and evaluation through projects that require complex problem solving Assessment ECMS values assessment and sees it as an essential piece of the learning process Teachers students and parents will all be actively involved in the assessment process and will communicate regularly about what the assessments show about the learner Through writing conferences peer evaluations and written feedback students and teachers will have an ongoing dialogue about what the students performance tells about what the student has learned and what the student is still struggling to learn Assessment is meant to be instructive and not punitive therefore multiple opportunities to redo assignments or to revise ones work will be the norm Teachers will make great efforts to ensure that students are very familiar with what is expected of them and will Taxonomy of Educational Objectives The Classification of Educational Goals pp B S Bloom Ed Susan Fauer Company Inc A Taxonomy for Learning Teaching and Assessing A Revision of Blooms Taxonomy of Educational Objectives Lorin W Anderson David R Krathwohl Peter W Airasian Kathleen A Cruikshank Richard E Mayer Paul R Pintrich James Raths and Merlin C Wittrock Eds Addison Wesley Longman Inc Environmental Charter Middle School coach students to reach those standards Parents students and teachers will meet at least three times a year to collaboratively review student performance data including NWEA scores CST scores grades attendance etc and to review the students formative course assessments The outcome of each of these meetings will be the creation or revision of the students learning plan which may include interventions such as afterschool courses tutoring or enrichment opportunities Report cards will be mailed home on a trimesterly basis and progress reports will be mailed home monthly In addition parents and students will have hour access to students grades scores on all class assignments test scores tardies and absences via the online student database PowerSchool The beauty of nature is honored and celebrated How this is lived at ECMS Experiences in nature ECMS recognizes that in order to become a steward of the environment one must develop an appreciation for nature Many young people living in an urban community may not have had many experiences in nature Therefore ECMS aims to provide many learning experiences for students that are outside of the urban environment Each year students will take at least three day field trips and at least one overnight field trip to a natural setting to actively learn about the environment and themselves These trips will be carefully designed to integrate academic learning and experiential learning in a safe manner that also allows for individual and group reflection Emphasis on natural materials When possible we use natural materials in our arts handwork furnishings and playthings This contributes a beautiful aesthetic nurtures our senses and connects us to the natural world We have found that beautiful classrooms that are softened with wood natural fabric softly painted walls flowerplants leads to more peaceful learning environments We also avoid using harsh or dangerous chemicals in our learning environment and limit the risk of exposure to toxins and other unhealthy substances Responsible use of materials and resources Students and teachers at ECMS value their class materials and resources and take steps to ensure that they are being used responsibly In each class everyone shares in this responsibility and time is taken to ensure that that responsibility is being met Use of disposable items such as paper and markers is tracked by students to alleviate waste Through class councils students evaluate how well the classroom and its materials are being taken care of and propose solutions to any problems in this area Pride in ones campus and community This ethic of care and responsibility is extended to the whole campus and the greater community Students regularly participate in campus and community cleanups ensure that waste recycling and compost stations are being properly used and promote campus and community beauty through mural projects gardens and landscaping Green Practices All members of the ECMS community will measure and monitor the schools ecological footprint with the goal of conserving energy and water and alleviating Environmental Charter Middle School waste These practices are adhered to on an organizationwide level with each community member having a clear role in meeting these goals What it means to be an educated person in the st Century An educated person is a selfmotivated lifelong learner who possesses the academic intellectual and socialemotional skills necessary for successful problemsolving effective communication and ongoing inquiry and discovery An educated person will be a critical and creative thinker He or she will have an understanding of the world and ones interdependence with our increasingly global

health of their community and the planet An educated person strives to be a leader in their community and strives to make a positive difference through their involvement in causes that they care about in their work personal or social communities Goals for enabling pupils to become selfmotivated competent lifelong learners ECMS will utilize a constructivist approach where students generate questions thereby facilitating authentic inquiry Students become inquirers when their natural curiosity has been nurtured They have acquired the skills necessary to conduct purposeful Environmental Charter Middle School constructive research They actively enjoy learning and their love of learning will be sustained throughout their lives This philosophy is promoted by a commitment to structured inquiry as a leading vehiclepedagogical approach for learning Inquiry is defined as a process initiated by the learner or the teacher who moves the learner from his or her current level of understanding to a new and deeper level of understanding ECMS recognizes many forms of inquiry based on young adolescents genuine curiosity and on their wanting and needing to know more about the world These include exploring wondering and questioning experimenting and playing with possibilities researching and seeking information collecting data and reporting findings etc This process of inquiry nurtures students innate curiosity and promotes a love of learning It is authentically individualized and permits students to develop deeper and more extensive projects according to their individual capacity The teacher will nurture and stimulate further the students natural curiosity by being a careful and thoughtful participant and a monitor of the exploration and investigation the children engage in or initiate and by stimulating their curiosity and inquiry through the presentation of surprises How Learning Best Occurs Since Environmental Charter High School has developed and maintained a unique and successful learning environment based on four best practices a small learning community a challenging interdisciplinary core academic curriculum authentic challenges and service learning projects and collaboration with partners ECMS will leverage the experience and expertise that has been developed by ECHS and will adapt these best practices to the unique needs of middle school students ECMS has added a fifth best practice a developmentallyfocused learning environment to ensure that all aspects of the learning environment serve to nurture and support the developmental needs of the middle school student In a small learning community ECMS believes that small learning communities promote more personal and supportive relationships between students teachers parents and their communities The benefits of small schools which are well documented in research include improved student attitudes towards school lower incidences of negative social behavior such as truancy classroom disruption vandalism aggressive behavior etc higher levels of extracurricular participation in a greater variety of activities higher attendance rates especially for minority and lowSES students improved retention rates improved International Baccalaureate Organization The Basis for Practice Environmental Charter Middle School students selfconcepts and sense of belonging and favorable interpersonal relationships among students ECMS will be structured to nurture the students transition from childhood to adolescence providing a supportive learning environment where each student in known well by a small group of caring and skilled teachers In grades and students will have two core teachers one specializing in Humanities the other in MathScience with whom they will spend most of their class time In grade students will have four core teachers each specializing in the four core subject areas ELA math science and social science Class sizes will average or less and th and th grade teachers will stay with students for two years in a row looping to ensure that all students individual needs are deeply understood and met Research has shown that the interdisciplinary team of two to four teachers working with a common group of students is the signature component of highperforming schools literally the heart of the school from which other desirable programs and experiences evolve Additionally all students will have an academic advisor that will meet with them daily and stay with them for their three years at ECMS With a challenging interdisciplinary core academic curriculum Subject areas and disciplines of ECMS are integrated and interrelated in a richly networked curriculum organized around a thematic focus the environment The curriculum connects subject areas to central concepts or key ideas Skills activities projects and higher order processes are used to construct meaning solve problems and discover relationships The thematic approach puts the teacher and students in charge of the curriculum and allows them to explore their interests Academic units of instruction will focus on topics of interest to this age group including survival rights and revolution The interdisciplinary approach allows for students to engage with the content in a much deeper meaningful way thereby increasing their motivation and comprehension This is evidenced by student work schoolwide assessments and standardized assessments Utilizing Authentic Challenges Culminating in Service Learning Projects ECMS strives to create a culture of purpose so that students have multiple opportunities to discover their passions and purpose Only when students discover personal meaning in their work do they apply their efforts with focus and imagination To this end students are

Departmentalized Classes Departmentalized courses for th graders honor their desire for and ability to handle greater independence cid Rotating Blocks Core classes will rotate by unit so that all students have the opportunity to learn different subjects at different times of the morning thereby tapping into the natural optimal learning periods for each student Environmental Charter Middle School cid Specialty Subject Classes The core curriculum is enriched by balanced specialty subject courses to further meet the developmental needs of the students while supporting the deeper understanding and integration of the core content cid Block Schedule minute instructional blocks allows for deeper instructional practices fewer transitions throughout the school day and a calmer learning environment Interdisciplinary Teaching Teams Teams of at the th and th grade level and teams of at the th grade levels allows for curriculum to be integrated and for students to be better supported by a small group of NCLB compliant teachers cid cid Looping Teachers stay with their students for two consecutive years th and th grades thereby increasing the support sense of community and continuity of skill development Advisors will stay with their advisees for all years cid Fewer students per teacher Since core teachers also teach specialty courses AVID and Green Tribes each teacher has a limited number of students that they teach for th and th grade core teachers and for th grade core subject teachers cid Closing SessionAdvisory Students will close each school day by meeting with their advisory teacher who is also their core teacher to recap important events of the day remind students of upcoming assignments projects or exams and to discuss any social issues that are important to the students This period helps to establish closure to the day and allows teachers another opportunity to checkin with each student cid Planning Time Common planning time is built into

developmental needs of young adolescents The instructional structure and teaching methodologies are researchbased and are proven to be aligned to the particular needs of our target student population ECMS is committed to using data to continuously examine student performance and to refine instructional practice The use of assessment data will be an essential aspect of the school culture and will drive decisionmaking from the classroom level to the organizational level Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that underperforming students receive prompt intervention as described in the section titled Meeting the Needs of Special Populations and that all subgroups advance at least at the same rate at the general population For more detail on assessment and the use of data see Element Differentiated Instruction Description ECMS intends to serve a diverse population of learners including students with disabilities advanced learners gifted students English Language Learners and a large percentage of students who are below grade level in the key subject areas Based on this knowledge ECMS teachers will apply differentiation to teaching and learning so that students have multiple options for taking in information and making sense of ideas The model of differentiated instruction requires teachers to be flexible in their approach to teaching and adjusting the curriculum and presentation of information to learners rather than expecting students to modify themselves for the curriculum Classroom teaching is a blend of wholeclass group and individual instruction Differentiated Instruction is a teaching theory based on the premise that instructional approaches should vary and be adapted in relation to individual and diverse students in classrooms The intent of differentiating instruction is to maximize each students growth and individual success by meeting each student where he or she is and assisting in the learning process ECMS will seek to hire teachers who are experienced at effective differentiation practice in their classrooms and will engage in ongoing professional development and training opportunities for teachers Using Blooms Taxonomy of Cognitive Educational Outcomes allows the teachers to design projects around the Content Process and Product that meet the needs of all levels of students in the class An example of how this works in

Differentiating for Diversity Principal Reston Va p Environmental Charter Middle School How each step in the research process PRODUCT Evaluation Group paper of one page Independent work Review and practice Five page paper with probing questions for independent study Five page paper and Power point presentation with computer generated graphics and tables In order to create a classroom learning environment that is effective for all learners the following guidelines will be practiced and modeled at ECMS The classroom teacher and the educational team made up of support staff and administrators must view diversified learning as a positive experience for students The classroom teacher and the educational team must believe that students from a variety of educational cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds enhance the learning climate for all students An atmosphere of cooperation and not competition must be established for both students and staff Teachers must utilize all available resources to support learning activities This requires individualizing learning for each student by arranging the classroom and the entire school for small group largegroup and independent learning Evidence of Effectiveness Differentiation is recognized to be a compilation of many theories and practices The principles and guidelines are rooted in years of educational theory and research For example differentiated instruction adopts the concept of readiness that is the difficulty of skills taught should be slightly in advance of the childs current level of mastery This is grounded in the work of Lev Vygotsky and the zone of proximal development ZPD the range at which learning takes place The classroom research by Fisher at al strongly supports the ZPD concept The researchers found that in classrooms where individuals were performing at a level of about accuracy students learned more and felt better about themselves and the subject area under study Other practices noted as central to differentiation have been validated in the effective teaching research conduced from the mid s to the present These practices include effective management procedures grouping students for instruction and engaging learners Norlund M Differentiated instruction Meeting the educational needs of al students in your classroom Lanham MD Scarecrow Education Tomlinson CA Allan S D Leadership for differentiating schools and classrooms Alexandria VA ASCD Ellis E S and Worthington L A Research synthesis on effective teaching principles and the design of quality tools for educators University of Oregon Technical Report No National Center to Improve the Tools of Educators Environmental Charter Middle School ProjectBased Learning Description Projectbased learning PBL is a model that organizes learning around projects that are complex tasks based on challenging questions or problems that involve students in design problem solving decision making or investigative activities give students the opportunity to work relatively autonomously over extended periods of time and culminate in realistic products or presentations At ECMS ProjectBased Learning will feature authentic content authentic assessment teacher facilitation cooperative learning reflection technology integration and measurable learning goals In addition students will often participate in field studies expeditions and collaborations with community partners to enhance their learning At ECMS Projectbased learning is a schoolwide learning method that is supported with resources professional development and mentoring by experienced teachers and curriculum developers ECMS primary features of Projectbased learning are consistent with researchers definitions of PBL PBL projects are central not peripheral to the curriculum PBL projects are focused on questions or problems that drive students to encounter and struggle with the central concepts and principles of a discipline Projects involve students in a constructive investigation Projects are studentdriven to some significant degree Projects are realistic not schoollike Evidence of Effectiveness According to a comprehensive review of research that has been conducted on Projectbased learning PBL seems to be equivalent or slightly better than other models of instruction for producing gains in general academic achievement and for developing lowerlevel cognitive skills in traditional subject matter areas More importantly there is some evidence that PBL in comparison to other instructional methods has value for enhancing the quality of students learning in subject matter areas leading to the tentative claim that learning higherlevel cognitive skills via PBL is associated with increased capability on the part of students for applying that learning in novel problemsolving contexts Furthermore there is ample evidence that PBL is an effective method for teaching students complex processes and procedures such as planning communicating problem solving and decision making PBL is especially effective when supported by educational technology In one of the best documented programs combining PBL and technology and involving a student

Interactive Multimedia Education Trial summary report New York Educational Development Center Environmental Charter Middle School Using the Environment as an Integrating Context for Improved Student Learning Description Using the environment as an integrating context for learning is actually an integrated system of instructional practices It weaves together six recognized best practices in education that comprise the cornerstones of ECMS instructional framework IntegratedInterdisciplinary Instruction crossing traditional subjectmatter boundaries Collaborative Instruction connecting teachers students and the community in shared learning experiences CommunityBased Investigations offering handson and mindson experiences relevant to students lives LearnerCentered Constructivist Approaches building on students interest needs knowledge and experience Cooperative and Independent Learning promoting collaboration among students yet encouraging individual students to maximize their potential and Using local Natural and Community Surroundings as the Context for instruction learning and service Evidence of Effectiveness In a comprehensive study of student performance in schools that report using the environment as an integrating context including comparative data of students in traditional classrooms the following benefits were evidenced Higher scores on standardized measures of academic achievement in reading writing math science and social studies reduced discipline and classroom management problems increased engagement and enthusiasm for learning and greater pride and ownership in their accomplishments Students taught using the environment as an integrating context scored higher on three of four comparative studies of standardized science achievement data than their peers from traditional programs All five comparative studies of achievement data from programs where math was integrated with environmental studies found that standardized measures affirm the academic benefits of environmentbased learning On the average the students taught using the environment as an integrating context outperformed their peers from traditional programs at all five of the schools that conducted these analyses All comparative studies of language arts achievement data found that standardized measures affirm the academic benefits of environmentalbased learning for reading writing and general language skills On the average the students taught using the environment as an integrating context outperformed their peers from traditional programs at all nine of the schools that conducted these analyses and State Education and Environment Roundtable Retrieved on from httpseerorgpagessystemhtml Lieberman Gerald A and Hoody Linda Closing the Achievement Gap Using the Environment as an Integrating Context for Learning San Diego CA Environmental Charter Middle School Ninetysix percent of educators responding to the learning survey respondents reported that students in environmentallythemed programs developed higherlevel criticalthinking skills than those of their traditional peers Educators reported that environmentalthemed learning has important effects on students thinking skills including percent of survey respondents a increased ability to think creatively b greater proficiency in solving problems and thinking strategically and c better application of systems thinking All nine of the comparative studies percent indicate that students taught using the environment as an integrating context demonstrate better behavior attendance and attitudes than traditional students Arts Integration Description Integrated arts education is a pedagogy in which the arts are deeply embedded within the core of interdisciplinary learning and affirms the indispensability of arts as a core curriculum subject and concurrently a catalyst to learn other subjects With integrated arts education arts play a major role in helping students address broad curriculum themes and achieve robust habits of mind including such characteristics as imagination discipline collaboration inquiry divergent problem solving empathy and making connections The focus is on enriching students abilities to attain analyze discern and invent knowledge Integrated arts education acknowledges and fosters Multiple Intelligences The emphasis is on both content and learning skills At ECMS artistic work is integrated into the daily and weekly curricula These arts may include modeling painting drawing handwork and woodwork Teachers use the art of storytelling in their classes daily to enliven the curricula Classes work with various forms of ageappropriate literature speech exercises poetry fiction and nonfiction prose Teachers are asked to see themselves as storytellers which helps to create powerful learning environments for students Students will also learn and sing songs as a class to build class unity and to connect song to the content All grade level teams will also create and perform pedagogical plays each year that are aligned to the content and skills of that year Evidence of Effectiveness Based on a study of over pupils attending public schools in grades a group of researchers from Teachers College Columbia University found significant relationships between rich inschool arts programs and creative cognitive and personal competencies needed for academic success The researchers found that young people in higharts groups performed better than those in lowarts groups on measures of creativity fluency imagination risk taking in learning expressing their ideas and problemsolving These gains were found not only in the arts but in the other subject areas as well including math language and science The study found that exposure to the arts in school was a stronger indicator of these gains than socioeconomic status Vermont Arts Council Arts Integration Retrieved on from

Research Teachers College Columbia University July Environmental Charter Middle School Looping Description Looping is an educational practice in which a single graded class of children stays with a teacher for two or more years or grade levels The children and the teacher remain together as the class is promoted At the end of the second year in the pattern the children move on to a new teacher while the looping teacher returns to the lower grade level to receive a new group of students th and th grade teachers at ECMS will loop with their students advisors will stay with their students for all three years Evidence of Effectiveness For students the benefits of looping include reduced apprehension at starting a new school year increased continuity and more indepth relationships with teacher and with peers For teachers the benefits of looping consist of becoming familiar with other developmental stages of children and working with students and parents for longer periods of time The longterm relationships established through looping have been shown to support student learning With looping a teacher can implement a more coherent instructional plan appropriate to the childs development Teachers gain extra teaching time Gettingtoknowyou time becomes virtually unnecessary during the second year Teacher knowledge about a childs intellectual strengths and weaknesses increases in a way that is impossible to achieve in a single year As one teacher noted I had watched my students skills emerge and solidify I was able to reinforce those skills in a style that was consistent over two years George and Alexander argue that for middle school students who generally need a supportive interpersonal structure a multiyear teacherstudent assignment is highly beneficial Technology Integration Description Technology presented as a tool much like knitting needles or a potters wheel helps show the connection between what is used and the outcome As a student grows proficient in study skills the tool of technology is consciously and slowly utilized Using the computer for communication and research is considered an important skill for the middle school student and is expected to be an acquired skill in high school Media literacy an expanded conceptualization of literacy is the ability to effectively analyze a wide variety of media At ECMS it is consciously interwoven as the study of the development of civilization unfolds from the historical role of the printing press to present day advertising aimed at teens as con sumers This is a basic skill for students entering high school Technology is also integrated into McClellan Looping Through the Years Teachers and Students Progressing Together Retrieved on from

Association of School Boards of Education Study Group on eLearning concluded eLearning will improve American education in valuable ways and should be universally implemented as soon as possible According to Lemke and Coughlin while further research studies are needed emerging trends indicate that under the right conditions such as using technology as a tool and not as a subject technology Accelerates enriches and deepens basic skills Motivates and engages students in learning Helps relate academics to the practices of todays workforce Strengthens teaching Contributes to change in schools Connects schools to the world Increases economic viability of tomorrows workers Social and Emotional Learning Description A growing number of educators are recognizing that the pursuit of an exclusively academic education leaves students illprepared for future challenges both as individuals and as members of society Academic performance itself as well as selfesteem character and human relationships suffer when the education of the whole person is neglected A new field social and emotional learning has emerged from new understandings of the nature of intelligence learning and success These new theories about the learning process combined with several decades of experience and research with a series of schoolbased prevention programs have given rise to a broad variety of high quality programs designed to teach a core of social and emotional capacities ECMS will adopt the Tribes program to address the social and emotional learning needs of students The program will be integrated into the curriculum and culture of the school and all teachers will receive training and resources to implement the program at the school Parents and students will be included as essential partners in this implementation process Edutopia PBL Research Summary Studies Validate ProjectBased Learning Retrieved on from httpwwwedutopiaorgprojectbasedlearningresearch National Association of

of multiple intelligence and soon educators began to see that they could respond to and cultivate not only cognitive intelligence but a broad range of human capacities including interpersonal social and intrapersonal emotional intelligences More recently Daniel Goleman documented that emotional intelligence is a greater predictor of academic and life success than IQ His concept of emotional literacy refers to the discovery that the emotional and social skills of children can be cultivated as part of the school curriculum and that doing so enhances cognitive learning and personal resiliency in the face of change and challenge In the same year Robert Sylwesters work made accessible to a wide variety of educators the implications of brain theory and research for schooling Emotion is very important to the educative process wrote Sylwester because it drives attention which drives learning and memory Because of the importance of emotion in engaging students in learning Sylwester suggested that emotionladen classroom activitiescan provide the important contextual memory prompts that a student may need in order to recall the informationin the world outside the school Response to Intervention Description ECMS will utilize the Response to Intervention program to respond to student needs This program is designed to address the educational needs of students within the general education classroom prior to referral to special education and utilizes classroombased and schoolwide interventions such as tutoring counseling instructional modifications and parental participation to respond to the needs of the student The goal of the Response to Intervention process is to create a common system wherein general education teachers special education teachers parents and other specialists work together Core concepts of RTI include early intervention using a problemsolving approach to make decision research based interventionsinstructions monitoring progress to inform instruction and using data to make decisions Because early intervention is a key component teachers or administrators can choose to accelerate the multistep process if student issues are serious Step A Classroom Instruction The RTI process begins in the classroom with teachers expectation that all students shall succeed ECMS teachers will use multiple assessment tools to monitor student progress and adjust instruction to meet the needs of individual students Step B Core Teachers Meeting If these adjustments are not sufficiently effective to resolve concerns the core teachers will meet to evaluate student strengths and challenges and collaborate on possible strategies to support student success A form is used to document student strengths areas of concern strategies attempted the results of these strategies and strategies to be tried The students Gardner Howard Frames of Mind Goleman Daniel Emotional Intelligence Sylwester Robert A Celebration of Neurons an Educators Guide to the Human Brain Environmental Charter Middle School situation is reevaluated at each subsequent coreteam meeting and if no or insufficient progress is seen a Student Success Team meeting is scheduled If the Response to Intervention program does not yield the desired results the Student Success Team will be convened The Student Success Team SST is a total school commitment to providing assistance in the general education classroom to students with special needs The SST is comprised of a school administrator teachers parents other professionals as deemed necessary and possibly the student if the team agrees that the students participation would be beneficial to the student The meeting provides an opportunity for each of the participants to share information and ideas that would improve the students ability to participate in his or her classroom The team may recommend program modifications use of alternative materials or equipment andor strategies or techniques that will enable the student to participate more effectively in the regular classroom The SST assists students by providing modifications and alternatives to meet the students needs ECMS is committed to resolving learning issues SST participation stimulates the school community to work together with a common focus of providing appropriate interventions and assistance for students with special needs in the least restrictive environment The SST is not a special education function It is not subject to the special education timelines or legal requirements The conclusion of the SST process may result in the referral for services through the provisions of a Section Plan services for English Language Learners GATE academic remediation or for Special Education Assessment ECMS will refer a student for a special education assessment when the team identifies that the modifications or assistance provided in the general education classroom is not sufficient in meeting the students needs Evidence of Effectiveness The Response to Intervention program has been successfully piloted by Environmental Charter High School who was selected by the Southwest SELPA to be a model charter school for the SELPA Environmental Charter Middle School Curriculum Sequence of Courses by Grade and Subject ECMSs Core Courses will use the California Content Standards and the goals of the No Child

written description of the core subjects is a matrix that describes the pacing of the core content and skills as well as the interdisciplinary and environmental integration of the course at each grade level While content standards are listed by trimester it should be noted that certain fundamental skills will be taught practiced and developed throughout the schoolyear English Language Arts ECMS will closely follow the California Content Standards While reading writing speaking and listening skills will be embedded throughout the curriculum in all courses the Humanities courses will anchor the program with a carefully planned sequence of lessons and practice activities Teachers will utilize a variety of strategies to teach and reinforce the skills and content that are developmentally and intellectually appropriate and challenging Reading ECMS recognizes that fluent independent reading is essential to academic success and lifelong learning and thus strives to strike a complementary balance between providing reading experiences that will motivate students to enjoy and continue reading and to provide students with the skills needed to improve their reading comprehension and skills As indicated in the Language Arts Content Standards by th grade students should be reading a million words annually on their own To this end ECMS will facilitate reading using a variety of strategies Independent Reading Students at ECMS will have time that is specifically planned for silent independent reading minutes two times a week at school and at least two hours at home each week Students will keep careful records of their reading allowing them to evaluate their own progress Students will set reading goals where they list items they plan to read over a foursix week period with an emphasis on variety including selections from the CDE Recommended Literature list The teacher utilizes the first reading goal as a tool to measure what a student is able to complete within the allotted time After the first goal is met the teacher meets individually with each student and they may modify the next reading goal coming up with a goal that is reasonable yet challenging for each student Over time these guidelines become more and more reflective of a students individual interest and ability allowing for differentiation and success for all students Each student records his or her reading goals in a reading record log At the end of the foursix week period students write a self assessment indicating whether they met the minimum goal andor read above and beyond Reading Circles Students will read a literary work each trimester that is aligned to the social studies and language arts content for that grade level Reading selections and assignments will be from the California Department of Education Recommended Literature Selections and will be tailored to each students reading level Students will at times be grouped based on reading levels and at other times in heterogeneous groupings Students will be guided through their reading through inclass and athome activities that will support their comprehension such as guided reading reflections group discussions and vocabulary building activities Students will also practice particular reading skills in wholeclass and small group settings based on student need These skillbased activities will include reading Environmental Charter Middle School comprehension strategies such as organizers summaries notetaking discussion and extension and application Family Literary Activities Teachers at ECMS will organize and host Family Literary Activities to encourage reading outside of school These activities will include family book clubs where family members will be invited to read a piece of literature and participate in discussion groups with teachers and students These book clubs will help to model reading comprehension strategies that parents can use at home will provide teachers with a greater understanding of the cultural context of the schools families and will help to bridge school and home Teachers will select texts that are readily available in English and Spanish and will conduct the discussion groups in both languages with the assistance of a translator if necessary to encourage all families to participate Additionally family members will be invited to assist with and attend literary events such as the annual pedagogical play student oral presentations and demonstrations of literary and artistic work Writing Writers Workshop Students at ECMS will practice all steps of the writing process from concept to publishing through the model of Writers Workshop Humanities teachers will address the writing genres and skills in the standards by scaffolding the process with students gradually building students writing skills over their three years at ECMS The writing process will include using concept organizers to understand subject area content and to organize the students writing selection of the appropriate form of writing tone and audience evaluation and revision including peer and teacher review incorporation of writing devices such as dialogue examples anecdotes etc correct incorporation and citation of evidence and others ideas and correct use of English language conventions The teacher will conduct lessons on the writing skills see the standards chart below throughout the process and will work individually with students on their particular needs Interdisciplinary Content Integration All of the writing genres from the California Content Standards can be taught by incorporating content from the other subject areas specifically social science and science This not only bridges the curriculum and brings greater relevance to the work but it also allows for more focused instructional time In addition to the integration of the core subjects the Humanities sequence will also feature activities from the socioemotional program Tribes integrated in reading writing and speaking exercises as the concepts addressed in Tribes are natural extensions of the curricular themes of survival th grade reason and rights th grade and revolution th grade Finally themes of environmentalism are thread throughout the curriculum as students engage in environmental service learning projects each semester See the scope and sequence matrix below for a more detailed depiction of this alignment Speaking and Listening The Humanities sequence at ECMS will feature multiple opportunities for students to practice and master their speaking and listening skills All students will complete at least one major speaking benchmark assessment per trimester that is aligned to the writing and speaking genres described in the content standards Additionally students will actively and orally interact with the texts literature non Environmental Charter Middle School fiction social science content etc through class and smallgroup discussions reading circles writing conferences peer writing critiques simulations theatrical productions and public readings of their written work Social ScienceHistory ECMS students will take a threeyear sequence of Social ScienceHistory courses as described in the California Content Standards The Social Science standards will be taught in coordination with the English Language Arts standards to focus student learning in an authentic manner When feasible and prudent reading selections will be of a historic nature including primary source historical documents and writing research and oral assignments will feature social science content see the following Scope and Sequence of Skills and Content matrix for a greater articulation of this integration Grade World History and Geography Ancient Civilizations th graders expand their understanding of history by studying the people and events that ushered in the dawn of the major Western and nonWestern ancient civilizations Geography is of special significance in the development of the human story Continued emphasis is placed on the everyday lives problems and accomplishments of people their role in developing social economic and political structures as well as in establishing and spreading ideas that helped transform the world forever Students develop higher levels of critical thinking by considering why civilizations developed where and when they did why they became dominant and why they declined Students analyze the interactions among the various cultures emphasizing their enduring contributions and the link despite time between the contemporary and ancient worlds th graders will examine the interaction between civilizations and their physical environment and the more complex human systems that emerge with the growth of cities Grade World History and Geography Medieval and Early Modern Times th graders study the social cultural and technological changes that occurred in Europe Africa and Asia in the years AD After reviewing the ancient world and the ways in which archaeologists and historians uncover the past students study the history and geography of great civilizations that were developing concurrently throughout the world during medieval and early modern times They examine the growing economic interaction among civilizations as well as the exchange of ideas beliefs technologies and commodities They learn about the resulting growth of Enlightenment philosophy and the new examination of the concepts of reason and authority the natural rights of human beings and the divine right of kings experimentalism in science and the dogma of belief Finally students assess the political forces let loose by the Enlightenment particularly the rise of democratic ideas and they learn about the continuing influence of these ideas in the world today th graders will examine the impact human society has upon the environment and how changes in the environment impacts upon human society Grade United States History Growth and Conflict th graders study the ideas issues and events from the framing of the Constitution up to World War I with an emphasis on Americas role in the war After reviewing the development of Americas democratic institutions founded on the JudeoChristian heritage and English parliamentary traditions particularly the shaping of the Constitution students trace the development of American politics society culture and economy and relate them to the emergence of major regional differences They Environmental Charter Middle School learn about the challenges facing the new nation with an emphasis on the causes course and consequences of the Civil War They make connections between the rise of industrialization and contemporary social and economic conditions th graders examine the role and influence of change revolution and innovation on American society Mathematics Math Integration At ECMS mathematics is conceptualized as a language that enables one to describe in precise and unambiguous terms whatever one is observing This is an essential step in problem solving and gives students additional tools to understand the world around them Each different branch of mathematics provides one with more vocabulary for comprehending the world and solving problems as just about ANY observable object phenomena or relationship can be described to some degree with the vocabulary mathematics A student who understands topic x of mathematics can then find a way to apply that knowledge to solve most problems whether they be of a scientific or social scientific nature branches ANY the of of of Math standards will be addressed in a linear fashion as required by the sequential skillbuilding nature of the subject and practiced throughout the year to maintain and reinforce learning Math will be integrated into the HistorySocial Science curriculum through an exploration of the discovery and application of mathematical concepts in historical situations for example measurement in early agriculture the development of algebra in ancient Egypt and Babylon or doubleentry bookkeeping in the high middle ages Math concepts and skills will be applied in service learning and environmental projects Pacing and Addressing Individual Needs In general students at ECMS will follow a math sequence of th grade math th grade PreAlgebra and th grade Algebra I or PreAlgebra depending on each students readiness for Algebra If a student demonstrates particularly advanced abilities in math it may be appropriate for them to take a different path which may include Algebra before th grade independent study online courses or courses at Environmental Charter High School which offers math courses from Algebra I to Advanced Placement Calculus Transportation via school vans will be available for middle school students taking classes at ECHS Similarly if a student demonstrates particular difficulty in the subject remedial assistance will be prescribed in after school classes a tutorial period or additional tutorial practice sessions at school or at home It is expected based on performance data and experience with a similar student population that students will enroll at ECMS an average of two years below grade level However their particular learning gaps will vary Therefore ECMS will utilize an intervention tool ALEKS to assist in the individualized instruction of each student ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesnt know in a course ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics he or she is most ready to learn As a student works through a course ALEKS periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are also retained ALEKS courses are very complete in their topic coverage and ALEKS avoids multiple choice questions httpwwwalekscomabout_aleks Environmental Charter Middle School The general sequence of instruction is as follows Math The first trimester of Math will include a review of the fundamental th grade standards especially in the area of Number Sense Students must have proficiency in basic computational skills in order to successfully learn and master the th grade standards By the end of grade six students have mastered the four arithmetic operations with whole numbers positive fractions positive decimals and positive and negative integers they accurately compute and solve problems They apply their knowledge to statistics and probability Students understand the concepts of mean median and mode of data sets and how to calculate the range

understanding of social science and scientific concepts cause and effect correlation and other data analysis For examples students will be able to mathematically compute the relationship between carcinogenic particulate matter found in the air and cases of lung cancer and other pulmonary diseases Algebra In Algebra I symbolic reasoning and calculations with symbols are central Through the study of algebra a student develops an understanding of the symbolic language of mathematics and the sciences In addition algebraic skills and concepts are developed and used in a wide variety of problemsolving situations Science Students at ECMS will take a threeyear sequence in Science The study of science serves to perfectly harness the natural curiosity wonderment and exploration that are hallmark characteristics of the young adolescent age group In th grade the focus is on Earth Science in th grade it is on Life Environmental Charter Middle School Science and in th grade the focus is on Physical Science Investigation and Experimentation skills are embedded in each year of science The Green Tribes course described in detail below serves as a natural laboratory for the Science core as students will engage in handson projects and experiments to actually experience what they are learning thereby acquiring a much deeper authentic understanding of the skills The Science standards will be integrated with the other core subjects through an exploration of common guiding questions Specific content connections are noted in the Scope and Sequence of Skills and Content matrix that follows Investigation and Experimentation Scientific progress is made by asking meaningful questions and conducting careful investigations As a basis for understanding this concept and addressing the content in the other three strands students should develop their own questions and perform investigations All the science classes feature the Investigation and Experimentation standard These skills are essential in the projectbased learning approach of ECMS and will be developed and honed throughout the three years at ECMS Science Earth Science The th grade Earth Science course provides students with the necessary knowledge and skills in earth science Concepts include characteristics of planet earth properties of minerals rock types weathering and erosion fossils energy resources plate

Act Environmental Charter Middle School Specialty Subject Programs Every child at ECMS participates in classes of specialty subjects designed to develop fine and gross motor skills and support flexible brain development The students acquire a new set of practical skills and develop competence and a capacity for selfexpression Today students often lack rhythm in their lives and have few meaningful tasks to occupy them The task of learning to work and act with purpose and skill has been passed to the schools Todays students need to be taught to apply their thinking and see results They need to develop practical skills to build their selfconfidence self reliance and independence Working with their own creativity relaxes children and helps them be more open to academic learning Musical visual and kinetic arts enhance the important and distinct neurological systems that drive attention emotion perception motivation motor coordination learning and memory The specialty subjects also provide teachers and students with a greater variety of experiences through which to learn the core content standards thereby increasing the depth and nuance of student learning The variety of

Process of creating interdisciplinary units Teachers have time to plan collaboratively during their hours of common planning time each week while the students take Arts Handwork and Games Movement Teacher also are given time before the school year begins to plan their interdisciplinary units Teachers begin by considering the guiding questions environmental themes and content standards to be covered in the trimester They choose appropriate summative assessments and tease out the embedded skills and concepts students need to succeed on the summative assessment Teachers also look for ways to connect the standardsbased unit to their classes affective lives for example if students are feeling excluded they might include literature that features themes of exclusion Mining the standards in this manner supports the classroom community and improves the instruction of the standard since the instruction is more likely to be relevant to the students lives Environmental Charter Middle School Teachers coordinate their units looking for ways to make connections between the disciplines They work to create a rhythm and balance to their individual units and between their units For example they utilize a variety of instructional strategies ensure students are working individually in groups and as a class ensemble and that the work is alternately energeticoutgoing and reflectiveinwardlooking They include a balance of artistic components into their lessons The teachers also work together to ensure their units meets the needs of all students reviewing IEPs plans an individual learning plans While the goal is to integrate as much as possible there may be standards that do not fit into an integrated thematic plan These standards will be taught in an unintegrated fashion Teachers will develop lesson plans for these standards using the schools core values Sample Integrated Unit Plan This unit is an example of how Environmental Charter Middle School will integrate its core curriculum and use its specialty program to reinforce the learning in the core classes This sample units theme is shelter and through this theme it teaches California Content standards across the curriculum This

Students learn about characteristics of biomes and about heat transfer contextualized as an exploration of the factors that influenced the types of shelters built by preurban humans Essential Questions How are human shelters influenced by the environments in which they are built Standards Heat moves in a predictable flow from warmer objects to cooler objects until all objects are at the same temperature As a basis for understanding this concept students know a energy can be carried from one place to another by heat flow b when fuel is consumed most of the energy released becomes heat energy c heat flows in solids by conduction which involves no flow of matter and in fluids by conduction and also by convection which involves flow of matter d heat energy is also transferred between objects by radiation radiation can travel through space Organisms in ecosystems exchange energy and nutrients among themselves and with the environment As a basis for understanding this concept students know c populations of organisms can be categorized by the functions they serve in an ecosystem d different kinds of organisms may play similar ecological roles in similar biomes e the number and types of organisms an ecosystem can support depends on the resources available and abiotic factors such as quantity of light and water range of temperatures and soil composition Sources of energy

Cornell Notes Weekly Learning Log Environmental Charter Middle School Typical Day at Environmental Charter Middle School Each morning Environmental Charter Middle School students proceed first to either their Humanities or MathScience core teacher They are greeted at the door by their core teacher who shakes their hand and makes eye contact After taking attendance and dealing with any other administrative issues the teacher begins instruction by signaling her students to stand and recite a quote or poem in unison This is followed by an assortment of activities designed to wake up students minds and bodies and to reinforce their sense of community The teacher might lead the class in a song that is connected to the content they are studying a sea shanty if they are studying the Age of Exploration or a medieval round if they are studying medieval history As the students sing their respiration rate increases and their senses sharpen If the song is in a round they must focus closely on their part while listening to the different parts being sung around them Thus students hear the remarkable sound they can make when they all focus and work together Another typical wakeup activity would be a mental math challenge where students practice the math skill they learned the previous week Students might be climbing on and off of their chairs as they respond to the differentiated math challenges or moving to different coordinates along X and Y axes drawn on the floor Once the morning routine is completed the students are ready to absorb new ideas and skills This group begins with their MathScience teacher who is introducing a thematic block on the scientific method Their humanities teacher is teaching an ancient Greece unit and the teachers have coordinated their curriculum so the presentation of the scientific method will be set in Ancient Greece The teacher begins with a narrativean evocative tale about a piece of amber The students hear how the amber was formed and how it eventually washed down a stream and was found by an Athenian shepherd Now the teacher takes on the role of the shepherd holding a real piece of amber admiring it and polishing it with a piece of cloth The shepherd takes the pretty stone to sell at the agora and while polishing it notices how pieces of fluff appear to stick to the stone The students are able to observe this phenomenon firsthand When the demonstration is over students write down their observations The observations are shared and the teacher guides students in differentiating between observations and assumptions Questions are developed and hypotheses posited and then recorded along with careful illustrations and descriptions of observations in student notebooks Teams of students begin developing experiments to test their hypotheses Following their MathScience core class students have a minute break for snackrecess After snack students go to their Humanities block This class also begins with a warmup to help prepare the students for work Then students begin presenting their biographies of different Ancient Greek philosophers and scientists In each presentation the student becomes the historical figure and delivers a speech about them Each student has some kind of visual aida model of Archimedes screw a drawing of a heliocentric solar system etc and the students wear simple costumes As students present other students are evaluating their presentations based on a rubric developed by the class and teacher on the previous day Following their Humanities class students have minutes for lunch and recess Lunch is eaten in the classroom with their teacher Sharing a meal is one way to strengthen bonds between Environmental Charter Middle School teacher and students The teachers presence ensures that lunch is a time for quiet conversation and eating Appropriate manners are modeled Each student brings a cloth napkin to spread on their desk and the teacher provides guidance about nutrition and recyclable or reusable lunch packing materials Students are responsible for tidying their desks before they are dismissed to recess All students have the opportunity to participate in the schools meal program which is part of the federal nutrition program Service is provided by the schools selected vendor Brown Bag Naturals who provides an organic lunch for students eligible for reduced or free meals and for students wishing to purchase lunch After the meal students are dismissed outdoors for a recess for the remainder of the lunch period After recess students go to specialty classes All students have hourlong sessions of AVID Green Tribes Games Movement and ArtsHandwork twice weekly This particular group has Games Movement In Games Movement students begin by reviewing a movement piece that will feature in their class play based upon the Odyssey With the tempo kept by a drum students practice moving as ships in a circle After a few minutes of practice students prepare for staff work Each student is given a foot long staff made of oneinch wooden doweling They have been taught to hold the staffs vertically with both hands Like a phalanx of Greek soldiers they practice drills with their staffs Students form two parallel lines four feet apart and face each other The Games teachers says Ready and toss and the students simultaneously toss the staffs to each other The staffs cross in the air Any error is clearly marked by the clanking sound of wood on concrete Once all the students complete an exchange successfully the lines take a step farther away and the toss is repeated After Games Movement the students go to Arts Handwork where they are working on fiber arts Like Odysseus Penelope they are weavers Students have washed and carded their wool and now they are working on spinning using drop spindles They consider the challenges of spinning and discus the differences between the various wool fibers they use Once they are all settled and working quietly their handcraft teacher or a parent volunteer reads to them from Homer At the close of the day students return to their coreadvisory teacher for Advisory The advisor and students review homework or any outstanding assignments If a burning issue has arisen during the day a Council may be held Before leaving for the day students recite a closing poem or quote or sing a song The teacher shakes their hands as they exit and thus the day concludes as it began Environmental Charter Middle School Meeting the Needs of Special Populations Students with Special Needs When students enroll at ECMS their enrollment papers and school records will be reviewed to determine any preexisting identification for special services including special education a plan English Language Learner Gifted and Talented or any other special need If indicated as such the student will be referred to the Special Education Coordinator for Special Education or the Principal for all others to ensure that appropriate monitoring and ongoing assessment takes place as described in greater detail in each section below For all students ECMS will employ a comprehensive diagnostic testing program upon entrance to the school This assessment will be used to detect academic strengths and deficits psychological social and emotional development and speech and language attainment ECMS will continue to monitor all students needs throughout the school year through the schools comprehensive assessment program which includes monthly progress reports trimesterly report cards parentadvisorstudent conferences times a year benchmark assessments various formative and summative assessments parent and student surveys and special conferences as initiated by the parent teacher or administrator If a student is identified as potentially having special needs the Comprehensive Identification and Referral Process will be initiated to determine the most appropriate response for each student English Language Learners ECMS will meet all requirements of federal and state law addressing to equal access to the curriculum for those who are English Language Learners ELLs The goal will be to develop high quality instructional programs and services for ELLs that allow them to achieve the same challenging grade level and graduation standards in the same proportions as nativeEnglish speaking students The Principal will be responsible for overseeing the identification assessment monitoring and reclassification of English Language Learners ECMS anticipates that approximately of its students will be identified as English Language Learners based on demographic data from the surrounding schools These schools data suggests that the vast majority of these students will have adequate English language skills to be mainstreamed into the regular classroom with appropriate support ECMS will support ELLs through A teaching staff qualified in second language pedagogy An after school and summer school program with a strong language literacy focus Supportive instructional practices Additional bilingual teachers aides in the classroom to assist ELLs in English intensive classes ESL classes as deemed necessary Environmental Charter Middle School Bilingual peer tutors ECMS will offer the core content areas in a sheltered English environment for students who are not proficient in English Sheltered content classes are subject matter courses with instructional content designed especially for ELL students The curriculum content for the ELL students will be the same curriculum delivered to English only students ELL students for whom sheltered instruction is not sufficient will be identified through the Response to Intervention process For these students additional services will be provided that may include an ESL class either during the school day or as an additional period afterschool tutoring an inclass aide or inclass peer tutor ECMS will recruit credentialed teachers who also have bilingual or ESL endorsements state authorization to teach ELLs such as BCLAD CLAD SB and who not only have training in second language pedagogy but also have experience teaching second language learners and sheltered English classes All teachers will be trained in appropriate methods for teaching ELLs at various levels of proficiency These methods will include using bilingual teacher aides and coaching preview and review strategies and after school tutoring programs that are coordinated with the regular curriculum and designed for ELLs ECMS teachers will be trained to use the state English Language Development standards The LAUSD ELD Handbook will be used as a resource guide for curriculum planning Selected teachers will attend appropriate LAUSD training usually offered in the spring This will allow these teachers to become qualified to train other teachers during ECMS inservice professional development Supplementary instructional materials will be selected from the CDEs list of recommended publishers to best fit the needs of ECMS ELL students Possible materials include cid New Leaf Educations Essential Word Academic Vocabulary Glossaries cid Curriculum Associates CARSSTARS cid Options Publishings Best Practices Intervention Packages cid Saddleback Publishings Reading in Context Instructional Practices Because all ECMS teachers at each grade level will be planning ways to integrate key reading writing and listening standards throughout the curriculum they will also all integrate corresponding ELD standards Presentation of subject matter in an integrated manner provides a thematic context for learning and helps ELLs gain a deeper understanding of concepts through several disciplinary pointsofview A paper published by the National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning entitled School Reform Student Diversity Case Studies of Exemplary Practices for LEP Students features a middle school that utilizes pairs of core curricula teachers extended blocks of instructional time and thematic units to effectively serve its ELL students In addition the handson activities in specialty classes Arts Handwork AVID Green Tribes and Games Movement creates a language rich environment with multiple opportunities to hear and use language Berman et al School Reform and Student Diversity Case Studies of Exemplary Practices for LEP Students Retrieved from National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and School Language Environmental Charter Middle School Teachers at ECMS will continuously introduce vocabulary varying sentence structures grammar and idioms They will employ scaffolding and SDAIE strategies to make grade level content accessible to students with developing English language skills Teachers in core and specialty classes will use strategies such as pictures realia graphic organizers games language modeling and cooperative learning to boost English language skills Teachers will regularly examine student progress toward the ELD standards and tailor instruction to ensure that students will make gains according to the English learner levels For example teacher teams will review ELD portfolios each trimester to determine which ELD standards to focus on for the following trimester Teachers will then create rubrics and plan instruction that targets those standards Teachers will also determine which content objectives are best suited for integration ie those that require students to use or understand complex language patterns or those that have a large amount of new vocabulary and provide practice using activities such as Total Physical Response Interview role plays and skits and games Teachers at each grade level will work together in planning the core instructional blocks to target students by ELD level The longer instructional blocks will allow more time for cooperative learning freeing the teacher to effectively target the needs of ELLs in small groups ECMS teachers will employ SDAIE Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English techniques to scaffold learning across the curriculum and support the learning of students identified as English Language Learners SDAIE instruction which benefits all students focuses on making academic input comprehensible through the use of strategies such as Realia and manipulatives real objects and materials Visuals drawings photos posters graphs tables maps multimedia presentations reproductions of paintings and documents Graphic organizers matrices Venn diagrams webs Planned opportunities for interaction between students creating a skit and acting it out thinkpairshare collaborative learning and studentgenerated stories based on personal experiences These strategies are also integral to the active artsintegration SDAIE instruction also focuses on strategies for taking students Into Through and Beyond the topics covered SDAIE enhanced instruction for a sixth grade world history unit on HunterGatherers and Early Farmers might proceed as follows Into Determining what the students know about the topic of study Possible SDAIE strategies for Into Anticipatory Guide Students are given a series of statements about Hunters and Gatherers and early Farmers For example Humans have always planted seeds and tended crops Students indicate AGREE or DISAGREE After the information has been presented students check to see if they were correct Environmental Charter Middle School Brainstorming Students are shown a chalkdrawing of a natural setting that includes the essential aspects of a grassland biome Students work in small groups Each group brainstorms what they would need to do to survive in that setting A recorder records all responses to that stimulus and ideas from each group are shared with the class Through The teacher enhances direct instruction on the topic by utilizing realia manipulatives visuals graphic organizers and various modes of interaction between students In addition to reading the text and listening to information presented by the teacher students take responsibility for learning by participating in groupwork and sharing understanding with others Possible SDAIE strategies for Through Graphic Organizers Students complete a variety of graphic organizers as they read or listen to information on Hunter Gatherers and Early Farmers Graphic organizers used might include ComparisonContrast Matrix Students determine similarities and differences between tribe strategies a Tundrabased grassland survival tribe and for in a Flowcharts Students sequence important events in the development of early man from early homini through the first agricultural revolution Cause and Effect Chart Students chart the ways in which geographical features shape survival strategies Reciprocal Teaching Two students work together to read a passage in the World History text Student A reads one paragraph aloud then asks Student B one or two good questions based on the reading Student B answers Students A and B discuss questions and answers and repeat the process Picture This Following the introduction of several key vocabulary terms related to the unit a blank paper is divided into eight sections Students draw pictures or symbols to represent words or major concepts They then exchange papers with a partner and try to correctly label each others drawings Choral Reading Poetry relating to the topics of hunting gathering farming and sheltering is read and then recited in unison Beyond To create further understanding students go beyond rote memorization and demonstrate realworld application of the learned information This process requires higherlevel criticalthinking skills Possible SDAIE strategies for Beyond PantomimeATale Groups select highlight from the historical fiction they read and act it out while one of the group members reads aloud Environmental Charter Middle School Quotes Students identify quotes from a fictional text related to the unit They select quotes that reflect and important aspect of the text or topic They do drawings or paintings to illustrate the quote and write a caption to explain the quotes significance In addition to employing SDAIE strategies for content instruction teachers will utilize time during the core instructional blocks for differentiated instruction During these periods students with similar language support needs can be grouped together for activities such as vocabulary previewreview teaching of specific language structures and additional oral language practice ECMS Procedures for English Language Learners Entering sixth grade ELL students will be assigned an ELD level based on criteria including CELDT scores elementary ELD level and review of LAUSD elementary ELD portfolios where applicable Once levels for incoming students are determined teachers will be provided with a roster of ELL students and their levels as well as the state ELD standards th grade span for each level represented in their class ELL student progress towards English proficiency will be monitored by the English teacher under the supervision of the Principal Student performance data will be reviewed at least three times a year or more often upon teacher administrator or parent request to determine appropriateness of the services provided to each ELL student and initial eligibility for Reclassification ECMS will administer the California English Language Development Test CELDT to all new students whose home language is other than English on their Home Language Survey and to all English Learners annually All score reports will be sent home and discussed with parents at the biannual parentadvisor conferences SST meetings or other meetings as needed Student proficiency levels will be identified according to State Board of Education ELD standards Beginning Early Intermediate Intermediate Early Advanced Advanced Each trimester teachers will be responsible for examining their instructional plan for the standards to be covered and identifying the relevant ELD standards to be taught and assessed during the trimester The teacher responsible for the ELAhumanities block will teach and assess the majority of ELD standards However when grade level teams identify key reading comprehension writing and listeningspeaking standards to be taught throughout all content areas ELD standards matching these ELA standards will be identified taught and assessed by the whole team At the end of each trimester teachers will summarize students mastery of standards for their current ELD level by looking at assessment material collected throughout the trimester ELL students will receive ELD grades in addition to humanities grades in reading writing listening and speaking These grades will numerical from with signifying meeting the standards for Environmental Charter Middle School the current level At the end of the trimester teachers will also go through the list of standards for a students current ELD level and determine if the student has mastered every standard for his or her current level and is ready to move to the next ELD level Teachers will present evidence eg scored writing samples rubrics from oral presentations to the Instructional Coach who will work with teachers to make the final decision regarding progression to the next ELD level Process of Reclassification of English Language Learners ECMS will form a reclassification committee comprised of teachers and an administrator to review evidence that students who are eligible for reclassification have met the schools criteria for reclassification The criteria include but are not limited to o Overall score of Early Advanced or Advanced on the CELDT o A mean scale score of at least on the EnglishLanguage Arts Section of the California Standards Test OR written documentation from at least classroom teachers that language is not the contributing cause of low test scores o Notice of Intent to Reclassify must be sent to the parents or guardians o English Teacher evaluation sheet completed o Principal classroom teacher or parent can initiate the reclassification process o Assessment evidence is presented to the reclassification committee who will decide to reclassify the student or not and make a recommendation for services o Students who are reclassified will have a onemonth and a sixmonth followup monitoring to determine if the student needs any additional support services Once the reclassification process is completed the following must happen Sticker placed on the Cum File with the date of reclassification RFEP noted Packet of reclassification documents placed in the Cumulative File Preparation of the day and sixmonth followup sheet Notice of Reclassification sent to the parent Students Language Fluency Classification documented on Power School Nonstandard English Speakers Recognizing that many students at ECMS may not be Standard English speakers many of the same guidelines and programs listed above will be followed for them so as to ease their transition into Standard English Specific strategies include Modeling standard English Building student communication skills through structured classroom participation in oral language presentations for projectbased learning culminations Training teachers to recognize when nonstandard English language interferes with learning Establishing a culture of appreciation for home language usage and culture Articulating and recognizing the importance of standard English usage in the world of work and education Environmental Charter Middle School Gifted and Talented Education Gifted and Talented students may arrive at ECMS already identified as GATE or be identified via ECMSs Comprehensive Identification and Referral Process The Principal will be responsible for overseeing the identification assessment monitoring and services provided for Gifted and Talented students Gifted and talented students are assessed and identified on the basis of intellectual creative academic or leadership ability and achievement talent in the visual and performing arts or other criteria that the school finds appropriate ECMS recognizes that its educational program must be flexible enough to accommodate students that achieve highly in all areas as well as those who demonstrate special abilities in just one area Process for Identification Identification is accomplished through an assessment process consisting of the following components identification and referral screening committee review and Principal verification Initial steps The school develops an initial list of potential candidates through the process of the comprehensive identification and referral The school administrator or designee screens students by collecting data from existing sources such as the cumulative record and progress report card The school GATE Committee makes a recommendation for consideration of eligibility of students When appropriate an intellectual assessment or an evaluation of academic abilities or audition in the performing arts or a demonstration in the visual arts may be required The Principal reviews all screening and assessment materials and determines the eligibility of students Guidelines for Recommendation Parents interested in having their child evaluated for GATE qualification should contact the Principal to initiate the comprehensive identification and referral process The following are the criteria for each category Environmental Charter Middle School INTELLECTUAL ABILITY Students who consistently exhibit the capacity for excellence at remarkably high levels of accomplishment far beyond their chronological peers One semester of observation by the

considered for the intellectual and academic categories Designated personnel under the supervision of the Principal make final determination of eligibility for students being considered for the talent categories Notification of Eligibility or Noneligibility School sends a letter of notification to be used to notify parents of students eligibility or noneligibility School files a copy of the Application for Identification containing the Committee Report on Eligibility or Noneligibility in students cum file Parents may request a copy from the school School receives a Parent Consent for Participation for each eligible student which parent must sign for student participation in the giftedtalented program The consent form must be kept in students cum file Implications for Instruction and Curriculum for GATE Students Students who during the course of the academic school year demonstrate an ability to advance at a faster pace andor a higher cognitive level in core academic areas will be challenged through an individualized learning plan in which learning outcomes are based on the California State Standards The individualized learning plan will be developed by the core curriculum teachers in consultation with the students parents The plan will include specific goals and strategies and progress will be evaluated when report cards are issued and reviewed at parent teacher conferences Individualized learning plans may include supplemental advanced reading material and indepth projects that are developed on an individual student basis to customize learning expectations Students will also be grouped heterogeneously to work with and learn from each other Differentiated Instruction ECMS emphasizes an educational culture of differentiated learning in which gifted and talented students can acquire skills and understanding at advanced ideological and creative levels matching their potentials Differentiated instruction includes complexity making connections or seeing relationships acceleration advanced content through curriculum compacting novelty introducing new areas of study and depth exploring a subject in greater depth Differentiation at ECMS includes lessons discussions and approaches that involve the whole class flexible groups within a class with students changing groups to be taught at the appropriate level tiered lessons that have specific learning objectives aligned to the needs of individual students and clustering of students in special classes Environmental Charter Middle School ECMS believes that differentiated instruction according to the abilities and achievement levels of individual students is the appropriate methodology for addressing the needs of all students from the lowest achieving to the most highly gifted Differentiation provides a richer more meaningful learning experience for all students by insuring that instruction is individually tailored to engage each student to achieve their full potential Consistent frequent use of differentiation over time raises the achievement levels of all students in the class See Framework for Instructional Design for a complete description of Differentiation at ECMS Acceleration Acceleration is a strategy that adjusts the pace of instruction to the gifted students capability for the purpose of providing an appropriate level of challenge Acceleration offers a way to meet the needs of highly able students when other forms of differentiation at grade level do not provide enough challenge Research documents the academic benefits and positive emotional outcomes of acceleration for gifted students when the needs of the student are carefully matched with the form of acceleration used Grouping Practices Flexible grouping will enable students with advanced abilities andor performance to receive suitably challenging instruction Flexible grouping will allow more appropriate advanced and accelerated instruction that more closely aligns with the rapidly developing skills and capabilities of gifted students Gifted children may not be gifted in all academic areas therefore grouping placements will be flexible for parttime flexible periods of time or activities when there are few identified gifted students in school Regular Classroom Our goal is to provide appropriate educational practices that motivate and challenge all students to achieve their potential To optimally provide for learners in our regular classrooms teachers will cid create an environment that is responsive to learners cid assess each learners knowledge understanding and interest cid cid differentiate and individualize the curriculum to meet each learners needs cid evaluate learning and teaching reflecting on the information obtained to adapt the integrate the intellectual process including both cognitive and affective abilities learning plan and improve the program Enrichment ECMS gifted students are served also by the schools emphasis on developing a diverse spectrum of highquality inschool enrichment programs and afterschool extracurricular activities These supplemental educational activities provide a framework for classes especially designed to address the varied talents of the schools gifted students that may include music art creative writing etc Gifted students may also participate in Environmental Charter High Schools afterschool extracurricular activities when appropriate including a Robotics program and an Applied Physics course ProjectBased Learning ECMS constructivist approach and projectbased learning model facilitates authentic inquiry and therefore is selfleveling Gifted students when engaged in authentic inquiry will naturally Environmental Charter Middle School develop projects that are more challenging and work at the analysis synthesis and evaluation end of Blooms Taxonomy This process of inquiry is authentically individualized and permits students to develop deeper and more extensive projects according to their individual capacity The teacher will nurture and stimulate further the students natural curiosity by being a careful and thoughtful participant and a monitor of the exploration and investigation Arts HandworkGreen Tribes In addition ECMS wholechild curricular focus challenges academicallygifted students in other areas GATE students may find appropriately difficult challenges in organizing student projects or tackling individual handson work in Arts and Handwork or Green Tribes Tribes A GATE students learning is further individualized via Environmental Charter Middle Schools socialemotional learning program where students will work to set individual short and long term goals such as for improvement of skills in specific academic areas development of individual talents and interests and pursuit of specific higher education or career objectives This program will provide academically gifted students the opportunity to work with their core curriculum teachers to set and meet goals specifically tailored for their own abilities and interests talented students understanding what differentiated Professional Development Professional development for ECMS teachers includes specific training in recognizing gifted and is and applying differentiation in the classroom The schools role includes counseling parents about parenting styles that support giftedness the cognitive and socioemotional needs of highachieving children and strategies to use at home to reinforce and extend differentiated experiences at school instruction Looping and Coring The structure of ECMS educational program supports teachers ability to individualize instruction Sixth and seventh grade core curricular teachers only instruct two cohorts of students and they stay with these students for two years affording them a greater opportunity to understand the individual capacities of each student Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students Environmental Charter Middle School recognizes that economic circumstances faced by low income families can add to the pressures already experienced by many adolescents and has put in place many supports to help support the needs of these students The school will provide a Free and Reduced Lunch program to ensure that students from lowincome families have the opportunity to eat an organic lunch that includes fresh fruit salad and fresh vegetables and entrees that are lowfat lowsugar and lowsalt ECMS is partnering with Brown Bag Naturals an organic meal service provider approved by the state as a nutrition vendor ECMS will reinforce healthy lifestyle choices through its academic program which includes a games and movement period twothree timesweek as well as active recess periods daily This regular physical exercise in combination with healthy food offerings and nutrition education is intended Environmental Charter Middle School to reduce student obesity and the risks of diabetes and heart problems Tribes ECMS social emotional learning program will also benefit socioeconomically disadvantaged students A metaanalysis of research on social emotional learning programs by the Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning CASEL determined that social and emotional learning SEL programming for elementary and middleschool students is a very promising approach to reducing problem behaviors promoting positive adjustment and enhancing academic performance The research analyzed indicated the SEL programs were successful for schools primarily serving ethnically and socioeconomically diverse student bodies ECMS instructional design is especially wellsuited to meeting the needs of lowincome and at risk students Sixth and seventh graders will have two core teachers who will stay with them for two years Looping has been shown to benefit lowincome students In a study in East Cleveland Ohio in a school district with percent African American students most from singlefamily homes and onehalf living at or below the poverty line researchers found students in looping classes performed better on reading and math assessments than their peers in traditional classes There were significant differences between the two groupsin some cases as much as a point difference in favor of the looping students ECMS schedule will support the achievement of socioeconomically disadvantaged students All students have their core content subjects before lunch For th and th grade students core content subjects and of specialty content is delivered by a team of two academic teachers who share a common planning period This structure will provide students with an age appropriate small learning community Students in eighth grade will be taught in a departmentalized program They will continue to have core content subjects scheduled before lunch Their four different teachers will also have common planning time which will be utilized for gradelevel collaboration as well as cross curricular planning Artsintegration has been shown to benefit disadvantaged learners As referenced previously on page in a study of over pupils attending public schools in grades a group of researchers from Teachers College Columbia University found significant relationships between rich inschool arts programs and creative cognitive and personal competencies needed for academic success The researchers found that young people in higharts groups performed better than those in lowarts groups on a variety of measures including creativity and problem solving Gains were also found not only in the arts but in the other subject areas as well including math language and science The study found that exposure to the arts in school was a stronger indicator of these gains than socioeconomic status Other research indicates that students with high involvement in the arts across the socioeconomic strata performed better in Payton J Weissberg RP Durlak JA Dymnicki AB Taylor RD Schellinger KB Pachan M The positive

students with low involvement For example lowSES students who were more involved in drama activities had greater reading proficiency and a more positive selfconcept and the gaps widened over time as compared to lowSES students with little or no involvement Disadvantaged ECMS students will also benefit from their participation in AVID classes Elective programs such as AVID Advancement Via Individual Determination help lowincome and historically disadvantaged youths who show potential a to grade point average to prepare for college These types of programs prepare students with study skills leadership opportunities college awareness and goal setting The programs have demonstrated results For example middle grades students in the AVID program enroll in algebra at a percent rate whereas the national average is percent The advisory program will support the needs of low income and atrisk students The program is designed to facilitate communication between home and family and to foster close and mutually respectful relationships Students will have the same advisor for sixth and seventh grades giving advisors time to develop strong communication ties to families Each day the advisor will recap important events of the day check binders and agendas and engage in teambuilding and goal setting This advisory period allows teachers another opportunity to checkin with each student Each students advisor will coordinate family communication including teacher conferences Advisor teachers review the grades standardized tests scores and current reading levels of their students and initiate Student Success Team meetings when necessary Advisors also serve as facilitators connecting students to other resources available at school and in the community Each advisor will have referral cards to refer families to services in the community as requested or indicated by their advisees When the components described above are not sufficient the ECMS Response to Intervention program is designed to respond to student needs As described on page the program will address the educational needs of students within the general education classroom prior to referral to special education and utilizes classroombased and schoolwide interventions such as tutoring counseling instructional modifications and parental participation to respond to the needs of the student Via the advisory program andor the Response to Intervention program students may receive information about outside community resources ECMS will support the medical needs of its at risk students through

as described in the Parent Engagement section supports the achievement of atrisk students However parents of low socioeconomic status students are often underrepresented among the ranks of parents involved with the schools Research indicates that the parents of disadvantaged children can and do make a positive contribution to their childrens achievement in school if they receive adequate training and encouragement in the types of parent involvement that can make a difference Even more significant the research dispels a popular myth by revealing as noted above that parents can make a difference regardless of their own levels of education Indeed disadvantaged children have the most to gain from parent involvement programs The research argues that the most successful parent participation efforts are those which offer parents a variety of roles in the context of a well organized and longlasting program Parents will need to be able to choose from a range of activities which accommodate different schedules preferences and capabilities The research indicates that it is most effective to provide orientation and training for parents but that intensive longlasting training is neither necessary nor feasible ECMS schoolfamily partnership will feature the following elements Professional development for the teachers underscoring the importance of family involvement and the many means of communication possible at ECMS Parent orientation program on the first day of school Making parents aware of NCLB and the schools participation Allowing parents to observe the

developing an Integrated Student Information System ISIS as required by the MCD Although most charter schools are not currently utilizing the Districts current SIS the MCD requires all charter schools to implement the use of ISIS once it is developed Section ECMS will be solely responsible for its compliance with Section and the ADA Facilities of ECMS will be accessible for students with disabilities in accordance with the ADA Further prior to operation ECMS will adopt a policy which outlines the requirements for identifying and serving students with a accommodation plan ECMS recognizes its legal responsibility to ensure that no qualified person with a disability shall on the basis of disability be excluded from participation be denied the benefits of or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under core instructional activities of the school A team will be assembled by the site administrator and shall include the parent or guardian the teacher and any other qualified persons knowledgeable about the student the meaning of the evaluation data placement options and the legal requirements for least restrictive environment The team will review the students existing records including academic social and behavioral records and is responsible for making a determination as to whether an evaluation for services is appropriate The Principal will be responsible for overseeing the identification assessment monitoring and servicing of students with Plans If the student has already been evaluated under the IDEIA and found to be ineligible those evaluations may be used to help determine eligibility under Section The student evaluation shall be carried out by the team who will evaluate the nature of the students disability and the impact upon the students education This evaluation will include consideration of any behaviors that interfere with regular participation in the educational program andor activities The team will consider all applicable student information in its evaluation including but not limited to the following information Tests and other evaluation materials that have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained personnel Tests and other evaluation materials including those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligent quotient Tests selected and administered so as to ensure that when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory manual or speaking skills the test results accurately reflect the students aptitude or achievement level or whatever factor the test purports to measure rather than Environmental Charter Middle School reflecting the students impaired sensory manual or speaking skills The final determination of whether the student will or will not be identified as a person with a disability is made by the team in writing and noticed in writing to the parent or guardian of the student in their primary language along with the procedural safeguards available to them If during the evaluation the team obtains information indicating possible eligibility of the student for special education per the IDEIA a referral for special education assessment may be made by the team If the student is found by the team to have a disability under Section the team shall be responsible for determining what if any accommodations are needed to ensure that the student receives the free and appropriate public education FAPE In developing the Plan the team shall consider all relevant information utilized during the evaluation of the student drawing upon a variety of sources including but not limited to assessments conducted by professional staff at ECMS The parent or guardian shall be invited to participate in team meetings where program modifications for the student will be determined and shall be given an opportunity to examine in advance all relevant records The Plan shall describe the Section disability and any program modification that may be necessary In considering the Plan a student with a disability requiring program modification shall be placed in regular instruction at ECMS along with those students who are not disabled to the extent appropriate to the individual needs of the student with a disability All team participants parents and guardians teachers must have a copy of each students Plan A copy of the Plan shall be maintained in the students file Each students Plan will be reviewed at least once per

previous years Reading and Math CST scores are Far Below Basic andor students who score more than three years below grade level on the NWEA Measures of Academic Progress ECMSs diagnostic assessment will be identified as at risk of retention In addition the schools Comprehensive Identification and Referral Process outlined above will result in the identification of continuing students who are at risk of retention The following will take place for those identified as at risk of retention Parents will be informed of the students academic standing within one week of identification Within three weeks of identification a conference will be scheduled between the student parent teachers and the administrative staff to develop an action plan The action plan will have specific responsibilities for the student parent and teachers Environmental Charter Middle School instruction by The student will receive supplemental support services such as oneto teacher andor aide computer one programmed learning tutorial to address specific individual needs summer school or a smallgroup class within the school day in lieu of a specialty class the classroom B Retention ECMS does not endorse social promotion and is committed to helping students achieve the necessary skills to progress from grade to grade yearly Because of the linguistic and socioeconomic barriers this student population may have faced readiness to move to the next grade level will be examined on an individual basis Each student will be assessed individually according to hisher total needs ECMS has clearly defined expectations for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level in each subject in an effort to equip all students with the academic skills that will enable them to be ready for entrance to and success in high school Promotion and retention of students will be based on multiple assessment measures to determine if the student is advanced proficient partially proficient or not proficient Assessment measures will include the student progress report based on degree of proficiency and teacher recommendations Students whose average rubric score classification is not proficient on the final student progress report for the academic year will be eligible for retention The principal andor teaching staff will prepare a written determination to specify the reasons for retention The written determination will include recommendations for interventions that are necessary to assist the student to attain acceptable levels of academic achievement The written determination will be provided to and discussed with the students parents the students teachers and the principal Students identified for retention must participate in a remediation program ie before or afterschool tutoring summer school ECMS will coordinate a summer program that is individualized in nature and designed to address the particular skill deficits of the student using computerized tutorials and individual or small group lessons with the teacher The students academic performance will be reassessed at the end of the remediation program and the decision to retain or promote the student will be reevaluated at that time The promotion and retention of special education students will be determined according to their Individualized Education Plan IEP Environmental Charter Middle School Strategic Instructional Program Implementation The following Strategic Instructional Program Implementation Pacing Guide defines a layered rollout of the Instructional Program outlining a systematic process by which each component would be introduced and stabilized before layering it with additional components of the schools vision thus eventually providing the access to the full depth of the academic program to promote student achievement During the first three years of operation you will note in the matrix below that ECMS will deliver its curriculum using the foundation of the California State Standards for each grade level Each grade level teaching team will use and further develop the instructional pacing charts provided in the charter based on these contented standards and supported by Scope and Sequence Charts embedded in Stateapproved textbooks Strategic Instructional Program Implementation Pacing Guide A careful review of this matrix clarifies the strategic implementation by

teaching experience in the middle school grades Environmental Charter Middle School Training or familiarity with the instructional methods identified by the school A deep desire to teach in an environmental charter school Teaching philosophy that is compatible with our educational philosophy Background in or a passion for the environment Excellent professional references Articulate and polished cover letters An interest in Environmental Charter Middle School Ongoing Professional Development Professional development is essential to the continuous improvement of the educational program and structures of the school The Principal will serve as the instructional leader of the school and will facilitate professional development utilizing the principles and structure of a Professional Learning Community Time for professional development has been built into the schedule to allow for two hours of all staff professional development sessions per week with two additional hours per week of common meeting time for teaching teams In addition there are half days of professional development planned during the school year and an additional days of professional development during the summer in June and prior to the start of the school year New teachers begin one week earlier than returning teachers for a thorough introduction to ECMS its mission core values and instructional strategies The PD days in June feature a comprehensive review of student and schoolwide data that results in the identification or revision of goals objectives strategies and benchmarks for the coming school year The PD days in August include training or retraining in the strategies that were identified in June Ongoing analysis of student data and the effectiveness of the identified strategies continues throughout the school year on the PD halfdays It is during these sessions that teachers may receive training from fellow educators both inhouse and outsourced on the identified instructional strategies described in the section titled Framework for Instructional Design In addition returning teachers participate in an additional hours of differentiated professional development that is aligned with the overall goals of the school and tailored to that teachers professional needs This differentiated professional development can include conferences collaborative curriculum development or coursework Monday morning Professional Development meetings are times when staff meets either in Subject Area Teams Grade Level Teams or Advisory Teams As well Grade Level teams meet weekly during lunch Monday meetings are reserved for topics that are aligned to schoolwide goals and objectives Monday morning sessions are focused on collaboration among teachers and the protocol for Professional Learning Communities is followed to structure this work see below Announcements and general housekeeping tasks are kept to a minimum in order to preserve this time to focus on teaching and learning General announcements are generally made via email or memo Environmental Charter Middle School Professional Learning Communities Based on the work of Richard DuFour and R Mazano ECMSs PLC will focus on the ongoing exploration of three crucial questions that drive the work of all teaching staff What do we want each student to learn How will we know when each student has learned it How will we respond when a student experiences difficulty in learning All Professional Development time and resources will be devoted to answering those questions with the overall goal of improving student learning Therefore the PLC will not only support teachers and students with assessing the quality of the learning that is taking place it will help to set the course and the continual adjustment to that course of implementing strategies to respond when some students do not learn Led by the Principal all teachers and aides will work on gradelevel teams serving common students to analyze and understand content standards student performance and student data Collaboratively they will identify and implementmodify teaching strategies and measure the impact of those strategies This collaborative work helps to create a culture of learning among students and teachers alike The powerful collaboration that characterizes professional learning communities is a systematic process in which teachers work together to analyze and improve their classroom practice Teachers work in teams engaging in an ongoing cycle of questions that promote deep team learning This process in turn leads to higher levels of student achievement In addition to being systematic and schoolwide the professional learning communitys response to students who experience difficulty is Timely The school quickly identifies students who need additional time and support Based on intervention rather than remediation The plan provides students with help as soon as they experience difficulty rather than relying on summer school retention and remedial courses Directive Instead of inviting students to seek additional help the systematic plan requires students to devote extra time and receive additional assistance until they have mastered the necessary concepts Professional learning communities judge their effectiveness on the basis of results Working together to improve student achievement will be the routine work of everyone in the school Every teacher team participates in an ongoing process of identifying the current level of student achievement establishing a goal to improve the current level working together to achieve that goal and providing periodic evidence of progress Team goals will be measured with student achievement data rather than by what the teacher taught Effective professional learning communities require hard and careful work All ECMS teachers will receive training and ongoing coaching to support the work of the PLC ECMS will use a comprehensive accountability system to gather organize and analyze student performance including the use of the Measure of Academic Progress MAP from the Northwest Evaluation Association NWEA NWEA provides tiered allstaff workshops to train teachers in the DuFour Richard What is a Professional Learning Community Educational Leadership May Volume Number Schools as Learning Communities Pages Environmental Charter Middle School

assessment measures It is ECMSs goal to exceed the average percentage of students in the district who test proficient and above in years Benchmarks to be met The achievement of Environmental Charter Middle School will be measured in both growth and absolute measures and will be compared to the achievement of selected District schools that are similar in demographic and other characteristics The criteria for selecting the comparison schools are Comparison Schools In gauging the success of Environmental Charter Middle School during the renewal term a group of comparison district schools will be selected that meet the following criteria The District will identify the comparison schools and will inform the charter of the names of the schools and the specific data used to identify them The analysis of the schools academic performance will include a comparison of the Environmental Charter Middle School academic achievement of Environmental Charter Middle Schools students to the academic achievement of two sets of comparison District schools a The residence schools Environmental Charter Middle School students would have otherwise attended Resident Schools and b District schools of similar demographic characteristics Demographically Similar Schools Comparison Resident Schools Resident Schools will be selected by using Environmental Charter Middle School students home addresses to identify the District schools they otherwise would have attended The District schools most represented at Environmental Charter Middle School will be chosen as comparison resident schools Demographically Similar Schools will be selected by using a modified version of the formula utilized by the state for creating its similar schools list Primary Growth Measures Growth in student achievement is the primary measure that will be used to determine whether the school has been an academic success in its renewal period The growth of Environmental Charter Middle School will be measured annually against the growth of the comparison schools At the time of renewal if Environmental Charter Middle School has met all of the following benchmarks either in the previous year or in two of the previous three years Environmental Charter Middle School will be considered an academic success a b c d e f g h i Environmental Charter Middle Schools value added for English Language Arts

Student outcomes means the extent to which all students of the school demonstrate that they have attained the skills knowledge and attitudes specified as goals in the schools educational program CA Education Code Section bC Assessment Plan for Environmental Charter Middle School Philosophy At Environmental Charter Middle School we are adaptingreplicating a methodology that we know produces results with high school students of a similar demographic These results are improved student learning and students who are lifelong learners and quality stewards of the community ECMS intends to teach more than the content standards our students will gain knowledge skills and values through our socialemotional learning program through our arts integration and through our environmentally focused projects Because we are teaching more than traditional schools and because of the particular needs of the population that we work with it is important that we document our students progress towards all of these goals and over time ECMS intends to pay careful attention to documenting and analyzing anecdotal and actual student achievement through a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures For the external audience this plan will provide validity to the work that we do allow us to document growth over time and allow us to better communicate the results of our practices to a wider audience in language that is understandable in the field For our internal audience this plan also provides a way to systemize our understanding and implementation of assessment and evaluation in support of our schools mission Therefore it is more than an assessment system it is a system and philosophy of what we value and how we help students learn It is a lifelong learning process for teachers and students While this plan will serve to provide the overarching structures and philosophies for our assessment and evaluation procedures at the school it is not a static procedure The act of teaching is a constant formative process In education you will never arrive at a place where it is all done and perfect and any dream of arriving at that place is misguided and disappointing What this plan will provide though is the structure process and data for supporting the questions and conversations that are the mechanisms of change Through a combination of national norm referenced tests statewide criterion referenced tests and a variety of locally designed assessments and evaluations this model will provide the data and discussions for assessing and addressing student learning ECMS Commitments to Assessment and Evaluation At ECMS teachers and administrators will Assess what we teach and teach what we assess Use assessment every day not just test day Environmental Charter Middle School Use multiple assessments and evaluations to get multiple types of information about what students know Challenge our students with rigorous lessons and rigorous assessments Use assessments that measure what students know and guides improvement for teachers and students We will use our assessment data for the purpose of growth rather than ranking Use both quantitative and qualitative methods that are valid and reliable Drive students towards mastery and proficiency Have an overall structure to focus on outcomes but one that allows the decision about how students get there to be up to the individual teacher Have teachers drive the design of assessments and instruction and therefore the execution of this plan Maintain a professional culture of dialogue around teaching and learning informed by data ECMS will comply with all state API and federal AYP assessment and accountability requirements applicable to charter schools ECMS will administer the California Standards Test CST and the California English Language Development Test CELDT If the charter school does not test ie STAR CELDT CAHSEE with the District the charter school hereby grants authority to the state of California to provide a copy of all test results directly to the District as well as the charter school ECMS will use both formal and informal entrylevel evaluations along with continual monitoring of student progress through formative and summative assessments These may at times include performancebased assessments portfolio reviews authentic projectbased assessment and standardized assessment tools These assessments will influence curricular choices and drive instruction providing a basis for scaffolding and differentiated instruction Preassessments will assist the teachers in activating students prior knowledge and in identifying any significant gaps in student understanding All formal performancebased assessments will be accompanied by a rubric that clearly outlined for the student the objectives of their assessment These authentic multiple measured ongoing assessments will serve as a lens to view the wholechild to whom ECMS is dedicated to educating Expected Student Learning Result Students will excel and reach their academic potential OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT MEASURE MONITORING TIMELINE REPORTING ECMS will meet or exceed the average API of

performing arts Portfolios of student work Presentations ECMS has created this assessment matrix with the belief that in order to accurately assess student achievement and effectively plan for further instruction assessments must meet the following criteria Authentic Student assessments must be authentic ECMS will use the Backward Design planning model to ensure assessments measure the actual learning that has taken place in the classroom Within this model pretests will be given learning outcomes established and assessments will be designed before any learning activities are introduced Teachers need to specifically know what skills and information they want their students to attain before they can design the learning steps necessary for achievement Because of this there will be less textbook developed tests and more projectbased assessments Multiple Measures Just as students have many different learning styles they also respond differently to different forms of assessments ECMS will therefore ensure a variety of assessments ie contentspecific tests observations projects standardized tests classroom discussions presentations be used to determine student achievement This multiple measures approach will improve the reliability of assessment data Ongoing Students need ongoing assessments in order to ascertain whether skills and knowledge have been truly internalized Teachers will use formative specific skills summative overall concepts and portfolio assessments as evidence of student achievement This compilation of student data will be used to drive instruction confer with parents and set learning goals within and across grade levels Use and Reporting of Data ECMS is convinced that data collection and analysis play a key role in the quality and efficiency of the school The school has selected the webbased Power School Information program and Data Director as the core of the schools student data management program These systems Allows comprehensive tracking of student information including student attendance demographic data free and reduced lunch eligibility and emergency information Enables ECMS to collect analyze and review data on student achievement in their academic skills by schoolwide standardized multiple measures Provides a platform from which to measure growth in affirmative attitudes cultural tolerance selfmotivation and social responsibility Demographic data free and reduced lunch eligibility and emergency information will be entered at the beginning of the school year by the office staff and updated when necessary Student attendance data will be entered into Power School by teachers for each class meeting Environmental Charter Middle School Following each testing cycle assessment data will be collected by the teacher and entered into Power School and Data Director a program that can run individual and aggregate test reports in a variety of formats The data will then be analyzed and reviewed by the teachers and the principal as a formative tool to drive curriculum development and inform instruction as well as a summative measure of student progress Individual student test results with instructions on interpreting the results will be mailed home after each NWEA testing cycle CST test administration and benchmark assessment administration The assessment data will be also be reviewed with parents at each regularlyscheduled parentadvisorstudent conference or more frequently as requested by the teacher or parent Teachers will also review the results with their students in class to ensure that students understand the purpose of the assessments their individual results and how classroom instruction is aligned to the assessments The goal of sharing the data with parents and students is to demystify the assessment process and to use assessment as a tool for instruction and communication about a students progress towards meeting state standards and schoolwide learning goals Student Assessment Data will be Processed and provided to staff in a graphic or tabular format that is easily understood Provided to staff during staff meetings and as guided by the Principal used to help monitor and improve individualized student achievement Provided to parents and guardians after each testing cycle and discussed in detail when they meet with their childs teacher at a biannual parent conference Analyzed and discussed during grade level meetings and across grade levels to target specific areas of strength and weakness in overall student achievement Evaluated biannually to create or modify a schoolwide strategic plan to address any areas in need of improvement within the schools overall educational program Student Progress Reports with detailed data on class assignments and assessments will be mailed home monthly and Report Cards will be mailed home trimesterly The School will issue comprehensive standardsbased report cards trimesterly In addition Interim Progress Reports will be distributed monthly but the school retains the ability to adapt the frequency of such reports in order to provide more effective and meaningful feedback to students and parents Formal parentteacher conferences will be organized three times annually to encourage open communication and detailed dialogue concerning individual students academic progress Annual parent surveys will be conducted to measure the levels of parent participation and satisfaction with all aspects of the schools educational program The School Accountability Report Card SARC will be developed and published annually before the April deadline ECMS asserts that assessment data must drive instructional practice not the reverse As teachers analyze the student data within their weekly team meetings they strategically plan for the safety nets and scaffolding necessary to support underperforming students Beyond that however they measure the effectiveness of their own instructional practices as valued by their students ability to comprehend and to quantify their understanding of conceptual ideas A continuous process of Environmental Charter Middle School selfreflection and data analysis will identify any needed adjustment in methodologies and delivery of curriculum In addition to this process of selfevaluation by the teachers the Principal will evaluate the effectiveness of the teachers instructional practices by reviewing the progress of students towards established standards their instructional techniques and strategies and their adherence to curricular objectives These performance evaluations are designed to identify the developmental needs and goals of teachers and provide targeted appropriate support and to develop a shared vision of teaching and improve teaching practices school wide in order to increase student learning The principal will provide desegregated data with comprehensive analysis of student achievement to the Board of Directors as least twice annually highlighting information that will assist the Board in developing policy identifying budgetary needs and recommending curricular adjustments ECMS teachers are continuously monitoring their students and their own development as learners and professionals Our interdisciplinary program allows for a myriad of opportunities for pre post and ongoing assessment of cognitive emotional and physical development State authorized standardized testing provides us with valuable feedback as to the efficacy of the academic instruction ECMS teachers meet at least twice per week to discuss student achievement and professional development Their goal is to match their instruction and professional development to the needs of the students Assessment data is used in the following ways to inform instructional approaches to inform the development of personal and institutional professional goals to inform parents and to inform students Assessment data will serve as the impetus for specific professional development activities and programmatic additions and changes We are a dedicated community of learners always striving to help students meet their potential and become proficient learners

Walkthroughs NWEA CST Benchmark Evaluations Portfolios Walkthroughs Parent Survey Objectives Environmental Charter Middle School TYPES OF ASSESSMENTS There are generally four ways of understanding assessments as formal or informal and as formative or summative Formal assessments are specifically designed and uniformly administered and scored Informal assessments by contrast can be as simple as teacher questions in a class discussion journals or quick reviews of homework assignments Formative and summative refer to the way the information is used in the student learning process Formative assessments help guide the teaching and learning process and inform instruction Summative assessments are actually evaluations of the sum of the students learning This assessment plan focuses on the design and administration of a combination of formal formative and summative assessments and evaluations While there is not a lot of focus on the more informal or formative classroom level assessments it is the intent of the plan that an ongoing focus on assessment and data will generate a subsequent dialogue on teaching and learning which will result in the use of informal and formal formative assessments that will guide instruction on a regular basis INFORMAL FORMAL FORMATIVE SUMMATIVE Environmental Charter Middle School FORMALFORMATIVE NWEA Parent Survey Walkthroughs FORMALSUMMATIVE CST

attendance of a school during a reporting period normally a school year divided by the number of days school is in session during this period ECMS will assume a attendance rate for our students ADA is used to calculate many of the revenue sources A attendance rate would yield an ADA of students in year one in year two and in subsequent years based on the projected enrollment above Revenues Revenue sources for charter schools come from federal and state governments and local private funding sources State block grants provide the largest source of funding constituting over of charter school funding in California Because of ECMS reliance on this single revenue source we will constantly monitor all components associated with state revenue throughout the year as the funding estimates are

Budget Budget Budget Budget Budget The General Purpose Block Grant GPBG is the largest source of revenue for ECMS The GPBG is calculated based on student Average Daily Attendance ADA and provides a

school in California receives the same amount of funds for each student as expressed in terms of ADA based on the grade level of the student These block grant funding amounts as well as other state revenues for charter schools are set annually by the State during the legislative process and are incorporated in the State budget each summer Funding amounts are typically scaled based on a Cost of

Projected Projected Projected Projected Projected Budget Budget Budget Budget Budget Budget ECMS categorical funding per unit of ADA for the sixyear projection period is shown above Categorical funding per ADA is additional block grant funding based upon an annual State Budget funding allocation This funding is per student and is allocated by grade span level The categorical block grant funding is in addition to the GPBG funding and is an accumulation of funding for each charter school student from multiple special purpose funds combined into one allocation Economic Impact Aid The In lieu of economic impact aid EIA is based on the poverty counts of pupils enrolled and minimum funding floors A per pupil rate governs for EMCS since they are above the minimum funding floor eligible students The per pupil rate being used is ECMS is eligible for an EIA concentration bonus since the school will serve high proportions of eligible students The concentration bonus adds poverty and English learner counts and if this is greater than of the student enrollment the bonus is applied Lottery Lottery funding is based upon recent estimates provided by School Services of California We project a total per student allocation of approximately per year Funding is based on annual ADA This estimate will be updated at the First Second and Third Interim Reporting periods These funds are available to startup schools but for cash flow purposes are not funded until year two Lottery funds are mainly allocated for general purpose use Unrestricted Funds with slightly over of the funds restricted for instructional purposes For simplicity all lottery revenue is shown as unrestricted Special Education Program ECMS will greatly benefit from the experience and success of Environmental Charter High Schools Special Education Program ECHS has operated an innovative and successful program since consistently serving a special education population of As a member of the Southwest SELPA ECHS has been selected to serve as a model for other charter schools in the SELPA and has received a grant to pilot a Response to Intervention model ECHS has operated its innovative program while maintaining complete compliance with SELPA policies state and federal laws and without a single formal complaint ECMS projects that approximately of its student population will be special education students This figure reflects that of the district and the local district school Peary Middle School Environmental Charter Middle School will adhere to the provisions of the Individuals with

Current Year Net Sources Uses Net Change In Fund Balance Ending Fund Balance Components of Ending Fund Balance Reserve Designated for Economic Uncertainty Unappropriated Amount No state authoritative body has determined how recommended reserve levels should be set for charter schools ECMS goal will be to maintain a minimum of of current expenditures each year based on current year operations as its Fund Balance Reserve for Economic Uncertainty The projected reserves will be monitored constantly and adjusted and refined as decisions and updates are provided relative to state funding amounts as well as when refinements or updates are made to the projected spending plan for the School As can be seen ECMS maintains a net Ending Fund Balance Reserve above its goal of for all years In addition to the Fund Balance Reserve ECMS will be building a cash balance reserve as identified in the current budget and cash flow documents Cash Flow Revenues Because revenues are lumpy and primarily from a single source correctly projecting cash flow is far more important than the budget for a charter schools financial health The greatest cash flow challenge is correctly predicting the flow of federal and state revenue sources California law identifies the percentage of a Schools Block Grant funds to be paid at specified dates This table is shown below Block Grant Funding Year Year

deferred Month July August September October November December January February March April May June Subtotal Next FY Total A Charter Schools Block Grant funding comes from a combination of two sources In Lieu Property Taxes and State Aid Amounts from these two sources flow to the Charter School monthly throughout the school year The Sponsor District pays the Charter School an In Lieu Property Tax amount per ADA on or before the th of each month State Aid is due from the state on or before the end of the month In Lieu Property Taxes are paid over a twelve month period from August through July State aid is paid monthly from July to June except that the June payment is deferred until July because of state funding constraints In year one ECMS is entitled to special advance state aid funding of of the annual projected state portion of the General Purpose Block Grant overall funds in September and in December Beyond year one ECMS is entitled to special advance state aid funding of of the annual projected state portion of the General Purpose Block Grant overall funds in September and in December for adding new grades Although no special advanced funding is received for ADA generated by expanding existing grades The Governors May Revise and subsequent budget revisions altered the base apportionment schedule and included additional deferrals The deferrals are summarized below July to December August to October November to January February to the July of the following fiscal year April to the August of the following fiscal year May to the August of the following fiscal year These deferrals have been reflected in our cash flow forecast Categorical Block Grant and Economic Impact Aid A Charter Schools Categorical Block Grant Funds and its Economic Impact Aid funding schedule follow the schedule for the General Purpose Block Grant However funding is made solely based on the State Aid schedule because no property taxes contribute to these programs California Lottery State Lottery Revenues are not paid during year one In year two the amount that should have been paid in year one is generally paid in December Year two payments are made quarterly beginning in December such that lottery payments are always delayed one quarter from the time they are accrued Title I Funding We project that Title I payments will be made in December of total April and June Loan Proceeds and Repayment of Debt Principal ECMS intends to secure a loan from the California Department of Education CDE Charter School Revolving Loan program The CDE loan will be drawn in Year and paid off during the next five years Expenditures ECMS is a labor intensive organization and its Expenditure Cash Flow projections are fairly straightforward calculations based upon the pay profile elected by our teachers Certain employer related cost factors such as retirement and tax contributions must be paid when earned regardless of when the salary is actually paid to the employee For other expenses ECMS generally has proportionally greater expenses in the first several months of the school year particularly during years one and two when new instructional supplies equipment and classroom supplies are ordered The State Revolving Loan will have annual debt service payments This debt service is deducted from the Schools State Aid Apportionment for those months After Year Expenditure Outflow will be fairly predictable with anomalies generally restricted to major capital or construction related expenses Budget Reconciliation Worksheet Because SACS specifies accrual accounting several revenue sources will be considered in the budget while actual cash payments from these sources will be delayed into the following school year as detailed above in the line by line analysis of revenue sources The Monthly Cash Flow Worksheet reconciles the yearly budget with the yearly cash flow indicating revenue sources which will be delayed and the actual time of payment

CDE English Language Arts and Math and for Median of Resident Schools English Language Arts and Math and higher than Median of Comparison Schools and Charter English Language Arts and Math Following are definitions of the School Performance Evaluation ratings An evaluation of accomplished applies to operations characterized overall by strengths There are very few weaknesses and any that do exist do not diminish the students experience While an evaluation of accomplished represents a high standard of operating it is a standard that should be achievable in all schools It implies that it is fully appropriate for a school to continue its operations without significant adjustment The school would always be expected to continue to take advantage of opportunities to improve however An evaluation of proficient applies to operations characterized by a number of strengths There are weaknesses but neither singly nor collectively do these have a significant adverse impact on the student experience An evaluation of proficient may be arrived at in a number of circumstances The school may provide a productive student experience but it may not provide consistent challenge for students Typically operations will be characterized by strengths but one or more weaknesses reduce the overall quality of the student experience An evaluation of developing applies to operations characterized by weaknesses which require remedial action by the school Some if not all staff responsible for the operation evaluated as inadequate require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement There may be some strengths but these are overshadowed by the impact of the weaknesses An evaluation of unsatisfactory applies when there are major weaknesses in operation that require immediate remedial action on the part of the school The student experience is at risk in significant respects In almost all cases staff responsible for operations evaluated unsatisfactory will require support from senior managers in planning and carrying out the necessary actions to effect improvement This may involve working alongside effective peers in or beyond the school Innovation and Charter Schools Division oversight deemed Student Achievement and Educational Performance at the school to be proficient Areas of particular strength include A new

gained a reputation for having a quality instructional program As this reputation spread throughout the community through word of mouth our student population continued to grow each year By the Fall of our student population grew to students Although we embraced the growth as an opportunity to serve more students every year the growth has brought one major challenge Celeritys API in dropped points from to Despite this drop in API our similar schools API ranking has increased from a in to a in demonstrating growth in out of years Most recently in Celeritys API increased by points to Overall Celerity Nascent Charter School has demonstrated API growth in out of years In addition in all years Celeritys percentage of students scoring Far Below Basic FBB Below Basic BB is less than the percentage of the median resident schools from which our students come from in ELA and Math Most recently in of our students scored FBB BB in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored FBB BB in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored FBB BB in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored FBB BB in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored FBB BB in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored FBB BB in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored FBB BB in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored FBB BB in Math as compared to in median resident schools Furthermore in all years Celeritys percentage of students scoring Proficient and Advanced is higher than the percentage of the median resident schools from which our Celerity Nascent Charter School January students come from in ELA and Math Most recently in of our students scored proficient and advanced in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored proficient and advanced in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored proficient and advanced in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored proficient and advanced in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored proficient and advanced in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored proficient and advanced in Math as compared to in median resident schools In of our students scored proficient and advanced in ELA as compared to in median resident schools and of our students scored proficient and advanced in Math as compared to in median resident schools Another challenge has been not meeting our AYP which has resulted in our current Program Improvement PI status In of our students met AYP proficiency goals as compared to of students from the median resident schools and none of our subgroups AfricanAmerican Latino Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and English Learners met the AYP criteria In Celerity did surpass the median resident schools with of our students meeting AYP proficiency goals as compared to the of students from the median resident schools More specifically in the Latino subgroup met both the ELA and Math AYP criteria while the AfricanAmerican and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged subgroups met ELA AYP criteria but did not meet the Math AYP criteria Also in the English Learner subgroup did not meet the ELA AYP criteria but did meet the Math AYP criteria In of our students met AYP proficiency goals as compared to of students from the median resident schools Last year we recognized that this is an area that will require much concerted and consistent effort In of our students met AYP proficiency goals as compared to of students from the median resident schools and all of our subgroups met the AYP criteria Although our API dropped from in to in our API has consistently surpassed that of the median resident schools In Celeritys API was while that of the median resident schools was In our API was while that of the median resident schools was In our API was while that of the median resident schools was Most recently our API rose points to in while that of the median resident schools was The strategies which resulted in this increase are shared below To address the point decline in our API and our PI status we reallocated our resources in the following ways Increased professional development Celerity continues to focus on improving instruction and student achievement We train teachers on culturally responsive standardsbased teaching the Principles of Learning and Projectbased learning In addition our professional development focuses on data standards and how to use both to drive instruction Our teachers also undergo training on Blooms Taxonomy ELD and SDAIE strategies and differentiation of instruction to meet Celerity Nascent Charter School January the needs of our diverse learners We believe that this is an ongoing improvement process and we will continue to train and develop our staff Additional support staff Celerity hired curriculum specialists The curriculum specialists primary responsibility is to increase academic student achievement by supporting and mentoring teachers The Curriculum Specialists also provide professional development during weekly staff meetings and during pupilfree professional development days The Curriculum specialists also meet weekly with gradelevel teams to analyze assessment data and provide support in using the data to guide instruction In addition we have hired an additional fulltime technology instructor and a fulltime technology specialist to support Celeritys network and use of technology in the classrooms ST Math software was purchased schoolwide to address the need for subgroups to meet AYP goals in mathematics Students learn critical thinking math and problem solving skills through the use of technology Students are motivated to learn abstract math concepts visually through comprehensible steps Study Island Celerity used Study Island assessments to monitor student achievement on a weekly basis During weekly gradelevel team meetings teachers analyzed Study Island data to monitor student achievement determine student strengths and needs and share successful strategies and techniques Teachers use this data to guide their instructional planning for the upcoming week Parents have opportunities to access Study Island home practice accounts Through these accounts parents are able to support their childs academic progress DataDirector Assessments Celerity Nascent Charter School used DataDirector assessments four times each school year to monitor student achievement and guide instruction The benchmark assessments were given in October December February and April of each school year Each assessment was aligned to the California State content standards and assesses mastery of these standards During pupilfree professional development days teachers analyzed the DataDirector results to identify reteach standards and revised lesson plans to incorporate these standards DataDirector results were shared with parents and students through meetings conferences and data walls All stakeholder groups used DataDirector results to celebrate progress and identify areas for growth Think Together After School Program this after school program was brought to Celerity to provide after school academic support that focuses on a standards Celerity Nascent Charter School January based curriculum for our students who are atrisk of being retained The site coordinator met with teachers to develop an individualized learning plan for students and to coordinate the after school learning activities with the learning from the school day The afterschool program also provided additional opportunities for students to take advantage of the Study Island and ST Math programs The changes implemented above have resulted in a point increase in our API raising our API to In addition we have met our AYP goals We will continue to implement the changes listed above and continue to increase student achievement through datadriven instruction The one change however will be that the after school program will no longer be outsources to Think Together but rather we have brought the program inhouse in order to more closely monitor program implementation and student achievement We are committed to ensuring that student achievement at Celerity continues to improve and that the AYP criteria for all of our subgroups are met yearly so as not to continue to be in Program Improvement status In retrospect one of our greatest successes is the use and implementation of technology into our curriculum Celerity Nascent Charter School currently owns laptops for student use resulting in laptop for every students Technology instructors plan lessons with classroom teachers that integrate with student projects Teachers and students use laptops weekly for ST Math practice and Study Island Assessments In addition every classroom is equipped with a media cart which contains a document projector and LCD projector for instructional use Celerity also uses PowerSchool as our student information system Through PowerSchool parents are able to log into their childs gradebook at their convenience to monitor and track their childs attendance meals and academic progress We will continue to develop our technology program and plan to incorporate Vbrick technology as an instructional tool into the classroom in the near future Another success is our teacher retention rate of Teachers feel supported by each other and work collaboratively to increase student achievement Celerity teachers also communicate with parents on a regular basis regarding the academic progress of their child Conferences classroom newsletters emails and phone calls are just a few examples of communication methods between teachers and parents In addition the administrative team has an opendoor policy for teachers to address concerns and to offer support Celerity will continue to hire credentialed teachers who have a commitment to and passion for working with atrisk students Celeritys inseat attendance rate of is a testament to a school environment where teachers genuinely care about each student and students in turn are motivated to come to school and learn Celerity Nascent Charter School has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the mission set forth in our original charter petition The mission of Celerity Nascent Charter School CNCS is to provide a school where at risk students will thrive in an atmosphere of high expectations and engaging curriculum with challenging learning activities In accordance with our mission we have enrolled atrisk students and many of our students come from program improvement schools The median resident schools from which our students come from are in Program Celerity Nascent Charter School January Improvement year with a state API ranking of and a similar schools ranking of Celerity teachers hold high expectations for each student while motivating and challenging students through handson projects and learning activities Although our student population has grown from students in to students in our students have outperformed median resident schools on the spring STARCST exams for the past four years In accordance with our charter our curriculum is aligned to California State Content Standards We have purchased and use HoughtonMifflinMcDougal Littell for Language Arts and Social Studies SaxonMcDougall Littell for Math and CPOFoss Kits for Science Students are provided with textbooks and learning materials to facilitate the learning process Integrated into our curriculum are the Principles of Learning and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy Our teachers are trained and work in collaborative gradelevel teams to infuse principles such as academic rigor accountable talk clear expectations recognition of accomplishment and fair and credible evaluations The cultures from which our students come from are valued assets that are respected in the classrooms and used to enhance student learning In addition students are allowed opportunities to demonstrate and integrate their learning through projects and handson learning activities Best practices at Celerity include Collaboration teachers meet weekly in gradelevel teams to analyze and disaggregate data use the data to drive instruction to share successful strategies and to support each other Data driven instruction on a weekly and bimonthly basis teachers analyze Study Island and DataDirector Assessment results to identify student strengths and areas of need This data is then used to guide lesson planning and design for the next week or assessment period Communication at Celerity we believe in overcommunication Teachers parents staff and administrators communicate via telephone cell phone email conferences newsletters and texting to ensure the success of each student PowerSchool is also another tool for communication with parents regarding their childs academic progress Technology technology is integrated into the curriculum for instructional delivery for assessments such as Study Island for teaching math skills through ST Math and to maintain our student information system on PowerSchool Meeting the needs of subgroups English Language Learners Another success is our English Language Learner reclassification rate Since opening in our English Language Learner population has Celerity Nascent Charter School January grown from ELLs to in In Celeritys redesignation rate was At the end of our third year Celerity redesignated students as Fluent English Proficient Celeritys redesignation rate during the school year was Professional Development is provided for Celerity teachers on ELD standards the ELD portfolios and reclassification criteria Teachers also use SDAIE and ELD strategies to meet the needs of ELL students AfricanAmerican Latino and SocioEconomically Disadvantaged Students Celerity teachers incorporate culturally responsive teaching and learning to tap into students prior knowledge and interests In addition teachers practice clear expectations incorporate a variety of strategies and techniques to check for understanding and deliver instruction in a variety of modalities to tailor learning for different learning styles Teachers use data and assessments formal and informal to target student needs create flexible grouping and guide instruction Teachers have also been trained in and incorporate Blooms Taxonomy into classroom instruction Students with Disabilities Students with disabilities are provided services according to their IEPs Teachers are trained in accommodations and modifications and provide accommodations for students as needed andor required The school Resource Teacher provides a variety of support services such as consulting with classroom teachers providing pushin and pullout services and teamteaching with general education teachers Celerity has also begun implementing the learning center model where both students with IEPs and general education students receive small group instruction from the Resource Teacher on an asneeded basis WASC In October we received our initial visit from a WASC team In January of we received confirmation that Celerity Nascent Charter School is WASC accredited through June The governing board of Celerity Nascent Charter School Celerity Educational Group consists of educators with over three decades of combined years of experience in the K setting Sound decisions that affect the educational program at Celerity are based on first hand experiences in education as classroom teachers coordinators and administrators In addition CEG board members also have legal and business experience and make sound legal and business decisions for the school Specifically the CEG board has made decisions that contribute to Celeritys success in the following ways Teacher Recruitment Our teacher salaries are competitive with LAUSDs salary table This allows us to selectively recruit qualified candidates Highly qualified teachers are recruited through various search methods such as EdJoin Craigslist and partnerships with Schools of Education at local universities such as Pepperdine University University of Southern California University of California Los Angeles Occidental College California State University Los Angeles and California State University Dominguez Hills Celerity Nascent Charter School January Salary benefits and class size In the midst of the recent budget cuts the CEG board did not cut teacher salaries maintained Celeritys benefits package and refused to increase class size This has had a significant positive impact on teacher retention staff morale and maintaining small classroom learning environments Meal Program The CEG board has approved our meal policy where all students regardless of free or reduced lunch status are fed breakfast andor lunch to ensure that hunger is not an obstacle to learning Reallocation of Resources The CEG board members exemplify their commitment to academic excellence through their decision to reallocate and prioritize resources in the midst of budget cuts In response to our decrease in API from to the board has approved bringing in a new afterschool program which is standardsbased adding additional formative assessments such as Study Island and DataDirector purchasing ST Math software to improve math instruction and hiring additional support staff curriculum specialists and technology instructors to support instruction and technology integration in the classroom Since Celerity Nascent Charter School has increased the achievement of atrisk students This has benefited the district in serving their atrisk students as many of our students come from resident schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Long term the district is benefited by Celeritys commitment to academic excellence and high expectations as we do not have a high school and many of our students who culminate in the th grade matriculate into LAUSD high schools The students from Celerity entering into LAUSD high schools will be wellprepared for high school AG requirements and college preparatory classes In addition Celerity is an example of a successful colocation charter district relationship Our colocation relationship with nd Street School serves as a model for other LAUSD campuses contemplating colocation agreements Through Celerity the Jefferson ParkCrenshaw Community has gained a community partner to educate their children hold neighborhood council meetings and host community events where parents students and staff members volunteer to feed families in need Many of our parents refer to Celerity as their second home Parents volunteer on a daily basis and many express their appreciation for the opportunity to be an active participant in their childrens education Students who attend Celerity will have an opportunity to be challenged in an environment where high expectations and academic excellence will be nonnegotiable Students will benefit from a small safe school environment where a respect for each other and each others differences will prevail Students who attend Celerity will benefit from an environment where parents and teachers will work in partnership to meet student achievement goals Celerity Nascent Charter School January Mission The mission of Celerity

adult learning b Creating structures for becoming well acquainted with students Celerity Nascent Charter School January Curriculum and Instructional Methods to Ensure that Standards are Met The instructional program is built around Lauren Resnicks Nine Principles of Learning The goal of the program is to create intelligence by teaching in ways that foster learningoriented goals and by organizing our schools in ways that promote effort Daily expectations are placed on students socializing them to be responsible for using metacognitive strategies and skills such as memorizing using resources reasoning problem solving and decisionmaking Students are taught how and when to ask questions when it is okay to request assistance when to collaborate and when it is appropriate to struggle through on their own for a while More specifically the middle school program consists of features that address the needs of the middle school students such as a block schedule and the recruitment of teachers who hold single subject credentials in English Math Science Social Studies and Art or teachers who hold multiple subject teaching credentials with subject matter authorizations in the core content areas listed above This targeting recruitment of teacher with indepth subject matter knowledge and expertise ensures that teachers understand the more complex middle school standards and are able to teach students the gradelevel appropriate content standards with depth and that students are able to demonstrate mastery of the content standards During block scheduling students transition between teachers and attend classes of minutes on Mondays Tuesdays Thursdays and Fridays meeting with their odd period teachers on Mondays and Thursdays and meet with their even period teachers on Tuesday and Fridays On Wednesdays students meet attend all periods for minutes each Another difference is the reviewESLIWT during the last minutes of each school day This block is devoted to ELD instruction for ELLs while nonELD students go to homeroom Advisory period for support The block scheduling enables our teachers to implement projectbased integrated and thematic instructional strategy by providing more time per class session to teach gradelevel content standards with depth and mastery while integrating content areas and using handson learning activities As students transition into the middle school environment the block schedule also allows for more technology instruction and allows for technology to be integrated into the other core content areas The goal of the technology program is for students to be technologically literate knowing how to use the computer in the ways professional use it daily In addition to receiving explicit instruction in basic typing skills Word Excel PowerPoint Students learn illustration and modeling applications in order to generate art work Multimedia arts music and video production are integrated through projects in a variety of subjects creating movies of ways to meet the Millennium Development Goals music videos explaining the structures within human cells and the functions of each structure etc Celerity Nascent Charter School January The Instructional Environments Celeritys environment will provide evidence of a highly rigorous curriculum clearly focused and articulated It will be implemented in a way that demands a significant amount of active mental work and questioning from not just some but all of the students This environment will be comprised of the principles explored below o Academic Rigor in a Thinking Curriculum This principle calls for a commitment to a knowledge core Students only acquire robust lasting knowledge if they themselves do the mental work of making sense of the problem Students will construct their own knowledge and the ideas they develop will be in good accord with known facts and established concepts Celerity will integrate rigor of content with highlevel thinking and active use of knowledge Reading comprehension reasoning writing and problem solving all of these thinking skills depend on what an individual knows We will have an articulated curriculum that progressively deepens students understanding of core concepts while avoiding needless repetition Every instructional task and assignment including extended projects in which original work and revision to standards is expected will demand students to raise questions problem solve think and reason Students will be challenged to construct explanations for their thinking and justification for their arguments not just to get the right answers o Accountable Talk During whole class discussion small group work peer or teacher conferences and interviews students will be accountable to the learning community knowledge and standards of evidence that are appropriate to the subject and generally accepted standards of reasoning Students will need to explain their reasoning give justifications for their proposals and challenges recognize and challenge misconceptions demand evidence for claims and arguments or interpret and revoice other students statements o Clear Expectations Teachers will communicate clear expectations about what students will learn how they will learn and what qualifies as good work They will set explicit content and performance standards that all students will work to achieve and will make those standards clear to everyonestudents teachers principals parents and the communityby displaying and discussing them regularly Students will know Celerity Nascent Charter School January what is expected and will be able to assess their progress toward a set goal They will therefore be able to take responsibility for their own learning Students accomplishments will frequently be recognized and celebrated Students will internalize the expectations by developing rubrics and criteria charts that express the standards for quality work in their own words By reflecting on exemplars and models of student work that meet or are on the way to meeting standards students will learn to judge the quality of their own and others work o SelfManagement of Learning Students will be explicitly taught to assume responsibility for their own learning through scaffolded learning experiences They will monitor and regulate their own cognitive processes with increasing spontaneity and sophistication They will monitor their own understanding of concepts and reflect what is being learned They will check for new insights among prior understanding and connect new information to their background knowledge by using metacognitive skills as well as by taking responsibility for their own learning Since students will take responsibility for they will work productively independently with a partner or in small groupswithout the need for constant adult supervision their own engagement with learning o Learning as Apprenticeship Extended projects and presentations of finished work to interested and critical audiences will be used The environment will be organized so that complex thinking and production is modeled and analyzed Celerity will utilize cognitive apprenticeship which includes modeling and observation active practice scaffolding coaching and guided reflection cid Modeling and observation Through this observation mediated by conversations in which critical features of the work or product are pointed out and processes analyzed students learn to discriminate good from poor practice and acceptable from unacceptable outcomes cid Active practice Students practice learning by developing products and performances under controlled conditions in and beyond the classroom cid Scaffolding Products will be created jointly with apprentices doing the part they can and masters or more advanced apprentices doing the more demanding parts As student apprentices begin to develop competence in a content area teachers will gradually reduce the Celerity Nascent Charter School January amount of support and scaffolding Self management skills will develop alongside expertise cid Coaching Student apprentices will be coached by their teachers visiting experts and their more advanced peers who observe comment challenge and suggest modification to the work cid Guided reflection Students will have the opportunity to continually engage in considering evaluating and improving on their work o Fair and Credible Evaluations The content of the evaluations will be known in advance allowing for systematically and effectively study The content of the evaluation will be related to the taught curriculum o Recognition of Accomplishment Students progress toward the achievement of rigorous performance standards will be frequently recognized and celebrated by special events and occasions that regularly allow family members friends and others who are important in their lives to witness and applaud the childrens accomplishments Culturally Responsive StandardsBased Classrooms and School Teachers administrators and support staff will communicate high expectations and through their words and actions respect for students culture history heritage and contextual cultural reality The indicators for this model are found in the classroom and school environment in lesson activities and in student work Classroom and school environment will reflect students culture and cultural context with multimedia learning centers that provide access to diverse learning styles such as listening centers video equipment and computers The classroom libraries will be culturally relevant and will reflect the students specific cultures The learning environment will reflect student participation in a variety of ways such as student created bulletin boards presentations project displays etc Lessons and activities will connect content with students prior knowledge life experiences contextual reality and cultural history The units will extend into students life outside of school Teachers will utilize KWL charts graphic organizers and culturally connected instructional strategies such as mnemonics storytelling and KIVA process The school home and community activities will authentically bring parents and families into academic units study Celerity Nascent Charter School January Student Work and projects will be displayed at various stages of development and will evidence their understanding of content in a manner that connects to their lives culture and cultural context Teachers will use authentic and alternative assessment instruments and student created rubrics and criteria charts to inform instruction and celebrate successes Curriculum CNCS will instruct students in the California Content Standards and use the California Content Standards to align the curriculum assess and monitor student progress design systematic support and intervention programs and encourage parent investment and community involvement After enrollment all students will be assessed to identify opportunities for support andor enrichment Prior to the beginning of the school year the teacher will meet with the parents to discuss an individual plan for the students learning The curricular standards will be broken down by quarterly reporting periods The parent will be able to assist with the development of the learning plan in a format that is comprehensible to them such as checklists etc The parent will also have an opportunity during this meeting to provide additional information that will assist the students learning Student assessments throughout the school year will be formative and summative such as statemandated standardized tests schooldesigned test using school generated rubrics based on state standards portfolios exhibits publisherdeveloped assignments and tests The CST will be the primary summative assessment utilized by CNCS Teachers will use the following instructional techniques to teach students the subject matter set forth in the standards direct instruction explicit teaching knowledgebased learning discoverylearning investigatory inquirybased problem solvingbased guided discovery settheorybased progressive or other methods These techniques will be utilized in the four core areas Language Arts The ultimate goal of the program will be to develop lifelong writers and readers Students will become strategic thinkers who use what they already know and what the text says to construct meaning Students will read authentic texts and write for real purposes on a daily basis They will experiment with a variety of genres English spelling handwriting and other mechanics will be taught within writing workshops Celerity Nascent Charter School January History Social Science Students will acquire core knowledge in history and social science while they develop critical thinking skills such as chronological and spatial thinking research evidence point of view and historical interpretation to study the past and its relationship to the present Students will also learn to distinguish the important from the unimportant to recognize vital connections between the present and the past and to dilemmas appreciate historical universal themes and Students will use biographies original documents diaries letters legends speeches and other narrative artifacts from our past found in archives museums historical sites and libraries to understand historical events by revealing the ideas values fears and dreams of them associated the people with Through the mastery of the standards students will know the facts and understand common and complex themes throughout history making connections among their own lives the lives of the people who came before them and the lives of those to come Science Science instruction combines student mastery of core vocabulary and conceptual knowledge with the application of scientific principals in laboratory settings Using both the handson FOSS in conjunction with the State Adopted FOSS Science Resources textbooks to complement the FOSS investigations and provide contentarea reading and CPO science curricula teachers ensure students have access to an engaging and challenging curriculum For example science assessments include sections that focus on the key terms and ideas of a unit as well as a performance task component that requires students to synthesize and analyze data from laboratory experiments Science teachers also integrate math to reinforce key mathematical concepts such as graphing and measurement skills Students also begin to understand how scientific processes operate and how those processes relate to one another Students Integrate the core concepts of science into a greater understanding of historysocial science mathematics and language arts Develop important habits of mind in the form of evidence connections and patterns supposition and meaning that produce active and thoughtful scientists Understand and intuitively use the scientific method identify a problem pose relevant questions state a hypothesis conduct an experiment understand the variables analyze the data and reach a conclusion or solution that serves as the hypothesis for the next round of inquiry Reflect upon ways scientific concepts and theories impact their lives through their environmental and personal health Students practice essential investigation and experimentation skills that will continue to be developed through middle and high school Students will participate in structured activities and work with expository reading materials that connect the world around them to the science content Students raise questions follow their curiosity and learn to be analytical They are encouraged to practice open and honest expression of ideas and observations they learn to listen to and consider the ideas and observations of other students Celerity Nascent Charter School January Mathematics Students will acquire computational and procedural skills conceptual understanding and problem solving skills They will Develop fluency in basic computational skills and procedural skills Develop an understanding of mathematical concepts Recognize and solve routine problems readily and find ways to reach a solution or goal where no routine path is apparent Communicate precisely about quantities logical relationships and unknown values through the use of signs symbols models graphs and mathematical terms Reason mathematically by gathering data analyzing evidence and building arguments to support or refute hypotheses Connect mathematical ideas and make connections between mathematics and other disciplines Apply mathematics to everyday life and develop an interest in pursuing advanced studies in mathematics and in a wide array of mathematically related career choices Develop an appreciation for the beauty and power of mathematics Technology By implementing technology with the curriculum Celerity Nascent Charter School ensures that students learn computer skills while pursuing academic goals CNCS maintains mobile laptop labs in locked carts to ensure that all students have

relatively affluent suburban counterparts The most important tool for tracking and monitoring student success at Celerity Nascent Charter School is the ILP An ILP is a statement of expectations achievement interventions and supports including curriculum and instruction which is developed by the students teacher in cooperation with a student and his or her parents The ILP is designed to address the performance standards for each student We see the ILP as a strategic plan for our students clearly outlining their strengths weaknesses opportunities and challenges The ILP would also contain any behavior modification strategies that would be needed for the student to succeed Low achieving students will initially be identified based upon low achievement scores as identified through the use of the following assessment tools California Standards Test reports report cardsprogress reports from the most recent school year Kindergarten Island and Checklists publisher provided CurriculumBased Assessments Study DataDirector For English Language Learners initial date of identification as an ELL or IFEP and progress in ELD level will also be reviewed and taken into consideration Celerity Nascent Charter School January The ILP will therefore not only set achievement benchmarks but shall outline the resources necessary to achieve the set goals for all students It will be used to pinpoint effective practices to meet the students needs and identify resources each student needs to be successful at Celerity Nascent Charter School ILPs shall spell out students longterm goals and the short term plans necessary to accomplish such goals Students teachers and parents will collaborate in making recommendations and suggestions for any needed interventions and together they will share responsibility for the students accomplishments Teachers will review each students ILP monthly By participating in the design of their learning plans students will identify their individual learning styles and develop potential academic strengths in an atmosphere of positive reinforcement and motivation Identifying Students In Need of Intervention Intervention Strategies Celerity Nascent Charter School continues to implement intervention strategies that reduce student dropout and underachievement In identifying students in need of intervention assistance Celerity

students with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for students who are identified as academically low achieving The initial component of Celerity Nascent Charter Schools program for lowachieving students is the early identification of students with deficiencies in any academic subject but especially Mathematics Science and English Language through our Individual Learning Plans ILPs Professional development for our teachers includes specific training in recognizing academically lowachieving students understanding how they can be helped to raise their achievement levels and applying appropriate methodologies including differentiation in the classroom Upon identification of any student as low achieving Parents are informed of the students academic standing within one week of identification Within two weeks of identification the school schedules a conference between the student parent teachers and the Faculty Advisor to develop an action plan The action plan has specific responsibilities for the student parent and teachers In those areas where the student is struggling most onetoone instruction is offered by the classroom teacher andor teachers assistant Paraprofessionals andor trained tutors recruited from the business community the collegeuniversity community and volunteer organizations provide remedial tutoring through individualized andor small group assistance Low achieving students are initially identified based upon low achievement scores as identified through the use of the following assessment tools California Standards TestCAT reports report cardsprogress reports from the most recent school year Kindergarten Checklists publisher provided CurriculumBased Assessments and AssessKnow For English Language Learners initial date of identification as an ELL or IFEP and progress in ELD level are reviewed and taken into consideration Some instructional strategies utilized for low achieving students include preteaching and reteaching skills and lessons in small groups using visual cues repetition modeling using graphic organizers printrich room Celerity Nascent Charter School January environment teaching through handson activities using realia and tutoring inschool and afterschool III Students at Risk of Retention Celerity Nascent Charter School holds high expectations for all students Therefore there will be no social promotions at the school Students at risk of failing to meet state adopted standards or who are at risk of retention will receive extra help involving some combination of differentiated instruction and supplemental education classes Emphasis will be on methods that allow low achieving and atrisk students gain new knowledge learn new strategies for acquiring information and solving problems and enhance their perspective on the value and excitement of learning These strategies will help bring these students up to grade level Faculty staff and administrators will work together to ensure that no individual student falls behind By instituting comprehensive support system for all studentsincluding small classes tutoring before and after school and on Saturdays this will insure that our low achieving students do not fall through the cracks IV English Language Learners New EL students are identified according to their home language and their scores on the California English Language Development Test CELDT to determine their individual proficiency level for purposes of planning their instruction Identified EL students are monitored by teacher observations the annual CELDT test and their academic progress Once an English learner student is identified a conference is scheduled with the parent to outline the instructional program the teachers role in implementing the instructional program the schools role in supporting the instructional program and the parents role in supporting the student to succeed The result of such meeting is incorporated into the students ILP Celerity Nascent Charter School makes every effort to recruit teachers who are bilingual or have state authorization to teach English learners such as BCLAD CLAD SB and who not only have training in second language pedagogy but also have experience teaching second language learners and sheltered English classes The English Language Development Program is a process through which the students achieve advanced fluency in all areas of language thinking speaking writing and reading Instruction is differentiated to address specific needs Students are actively involved in questioning collecting data reflecting on the information using the information and assessing their work CNCS uses Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English SDAIE and English Language Development ELD strategies to provide students access to the core curriculum through a contentbased and scaffolded program In order to enhance academic achievement the program activates and builds on prior knowledge sets the purpose for learning Celerity Nascent Charter School January focuses on acquiring vocabulary in context provides opportunities for direct teaching of skills and problem solving provides opportunities for scaffolded language and content Classroom teachers use graphic organizers preteach and reteach activities during small group sessions student conference period etc The program is individualized for students depending on where they are in the English language continuum Students at the lower ELD levels have more context embedded materials As they progress in acquiring English language the concepts become more abstract The focus of learning moves from learning to read to reading to learn where students process content and information To help ensure access of EL students to all content areas Celerity Nascent Charter School provides staff development to all teachers of EL students in instructional methodologies that support the special learning needs of second language students Additionally any teacher who teaches English classes for EL students holds an appropriate credential or demonstrates satisfactory progress toward obtaining such credentials CNCS uses the following instructional materials and instructional resources to support ELD ESL students classroom instruction is aligned to ELD instructional framework and standards students are taught how to use thesauruses English Language Arts textbooks and materials are stateadopted and contain a builtin ELD component supplemental ELD material such as Into English from Hampton Brown are used in the Kinder through rd grade classrooms while Highpoint from Hampton Brown are used in the th through th grade classrooms each classroom contains a culturally relevant classroom library classroom instruction incorporates the use of handson activities using realia and manipulatives and technology is used as a tool for language acquisition To assist students who do not progress through the ELD Levels CNCS teachers infuse culturally relevant pedagogy into the classrooms In addition gradelevel collaborative units and projects contain differentiated lessons for ELLs Classroom instruction incorporates the use of scaffolding techniques and graphic organizers Students struggling with English language acquisition also have opportunities to learn in flexible small groups and oneonone instruction with the teacher andor teacher assistant ELD Portfolios are used to monitor and document language acquisition for each ELL ELL student progress toward the ELD standards is examined times a year through ELA assessments such as the Houghton Mifflin curriculum based assessments DataDirector Benchmark Assessments and Study Island Assessments and ELD Portfolios ELLs also have opportunities to receive additional instructional support during CNCS afterschool tutoring and summer school intervention programs th and th grade ELL students receive daily ELD instruction during the review block period During this period the th and th grade ELL students receive direct ELD instruction through the use of supplemental ELD resources such as Highpoint by Hampton Brown The goal for reclassification is for all ELL students to gain fluency in English as quickly as possible in a nonthreatening setting Celerity Nascent Charter School uses the following criteria for reclassifying English Language Learners ELL Students in grades and Celerity Nascent Charter School January The student has an Annual CELDT overall performance level of or with skill area scores of or higher in Listening Speaking Reading and Writing The student is judged successful in a mainstream English program based on marks of or in English Language Arts on the Elementary Progress Report The student meets proficiency goals on three

environment Low SES students are taught cognitive strategies such as the structure of language how to establish goalsetting and procedural selftalk how to sort relevant from irrelevant cues and how to use mental models In addition CNCS teachers use kinesthetic approaches rubrics graphic organizers and flexible grouping for instruction based on identified student needs Immediate intervention for struggling students is also provided through oneonone support inschool and after school tutoring and small group instruction Professional development is focused on intentional instruction reflecting a diagnostic approach that is driven by identified instructional needs To support low SES students CNCS teachers receive training in the following topics how to use assessment data to guide instruction broadbased planning that sets meaningful benchmarks for improvement the importance of positive teacherstudent relationships and how to incorporate continual Celerity Nascent Charter School January monitoring and assessment to guide instruction Professional development also works to build a professional learning community Celerity Nascent Charter School also supports the economic needs of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds through the following ways canned goods drives sponsoring community events such as Feed where families receive a weeks worth of food and toiletries for a family of four providing school uniforms for parents who cannot afford to purchase school uniforms providing bus tokens for parents who do not have transportation and are financially unable to purchase tokens arranging for families to carpool to ensure that students come to school ontime daily and donating groceries to families who do not have food to eat VI Special Education Special

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Report Number Date January Subject Denial of the Charter Petition for Via Nueva Academy Responsible Staff Name Jos ColeGutirrez Director OfficeDivision Innovation and Charter Schools Division Telephone No BOARD REPORT Action Proposed Deny the charter petition for Via Nueva Academy Background Staff proposes that the Board of Education deny the charter petition for Via Nueva Academy on the grounds that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements as set forth in Education Code bAP It is also recommended that the Board of Education adopt the Findings of Fact supporting the recommendation on file in the Innovation and Charter Schools Division Via Nueva Academy was previously recommended for denial at the May LAUSD Board meeting please reference Board report revised The denial recommendation was based upon the grounds that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements as set forth in Education Code bAP The findings included a description of a governance structure that was problematic and created inappropriately Just prior to the scheduled board meeting for action the Via Nueva Foundation withdrew the petition and their request for board action On October a petition was resubmitted to establish Via Nueva Academy with students in grades and expanding to students in grades with the schools proposed location in Local District Board District The resubmitted petition includes the same problematic governance structure previously cited The educational focus of Via Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Nueva Academy is on college preparation and character development The Innovation and Charters Schools Division reviewed the charter petition performed due diligence and reviewed the May findings of fact and found that that the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the petition lacked a reasonably comprehensive description of the elements set forth in Education Code bAP and The petitioner was notified on November of the districts finding that the petitioner team is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program The petitioner notified the Innovation and Charter School Division on December to proceed with Board action even with a recommendation of denial The Innovation and Charter Schools Division has analyzed the Via Nueva Academys charter petition and determined that the petition does not satisfy the standards set forth in Education Code Education Code b sets forth grounds for denying a charter petition The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of or The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the sixteen elements set forth in b Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Subsequent to the petitioners request for a public hearing before the Board of Education elements were reviewed by the Superintendents Advisory Committee and the Office of General Counsel Elements and were found to be not reasonably comprehensive The budget for the proposed charter school was reviewed by the Innovation and Charter Schools Divisions fiscal staff and was found to be not reasonably comprehensive as well Detailed reviews of the charter petition and budget are submitted in the Finding of Facts accompanying this Board Report Note A capacity interview of the full board of Via Nueva was not held due to the petitioners request to take the petition forward to the Board of Education with a recommendation for denial The determination regarding the lack of capacity is based upon submitted documents and information ascertained from the Via Nueva Foundation Board President and Via Nueva board minutes Supporting documentation and further detail is provided in the Findings of Fact and Charter School Petition Review Form which can be accessed by contacting the Innovation and Charter Schools Division South Beaudry Avenue Los Angeles California th Floor Expected Outcomes All charter schools are expected to operate in a manner consistent with local state and federal ordinances laws and regulations and the terms and conditions set forth in its petition The benchmarks for achievement will be set forth in their petitions Board Options and Consequences Yes The denial of the of the charter of Via Nueva Academy would prevent the establishment of Via Nueva Academy as a charter school unless Via Nueva Academy appeals the denial and the appeal is granted by the Los Angeles County Board of Education or California State Board of Education No The failure to deny the charter of Via Nueva Academy could allow Via Nueva Academy to operate as a LAUSD authorized charter school should the Board of Education make such a determination Policy Implications The Policy for Charter Schools adopted in Budget Impact State Revenue Limit income and various other income sources to the District are reduced when current District students enroll at a charter school and comparable or offsetting expenditure savings may not occur in such cases Under Education Code section c a school district that Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report grants a charter to or operates a charter school that is formed as a non profit public benefit corporation is not held liable for the charter schools debts or obligations as long as the school district complies with all oversight responsibilities The District will continue to have monitoring and supervisory responsibility for charter school finances as specified in the Charter Schools Act Any modifications to the charter schools petition or operations with significant financial implications would require District approval prior to implementation Petition approval is also contingent upon adequate liability insurance coverage Issues and Analysis There are legal issues identified by the Office of General Counsel and Innovation and Charter Schools Division Please see the Findings of Fact The relationshipconnection between charter school board members and Academica California personnel not only may result in diminished board impartiality towards Academica California but may result in a situation where Academica California becomes the de facto charter school operator especially considering the level and type of services to be provided by Academica California Since LAUSD does not have a contractual relationship with Academica California with no ability to access its records the charter schools lack of independence from Academica California may limit the ability of LAUSD to exercise its oversight responsibilities over the charter school significantly

Morris Judy Elliott David Holmquist Jerry Thornton Jefferson Crain Via Nueva Academy Charter School Charter Petition Findings of Fact January The charter review process requires the authorizer to evaluate whether the charter petition meets the criteria for approval Education Code Section b states the required petition elements and conditions for denial Education Code Section outlines additional petition criteria The Petition of Via Nueva Academy Charter School Via Nueva or charter school does not meet the criteria under Education Code section b Education Code section b states A school district governing board shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice Education code section b provides that the governing board shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings specific to the particular petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision a of Education Code The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision d of Education Code The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements LAUSDs analysis of the charter petition resubmitted on or about October to LAUSD by Via Nueva indicates Regarding above The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition The Via Nueva Foundation has contracted with Academica California LLC Academica California a forprofit management company for the purpose of having Academica California manage and administer the charter school Based on the relationship between the charter school and Academica California portrayed in the Management Agreement between the parties and the dependence of Via Nueva Foundation on Academica California for the successful continued operation of the charter school it is not clear to LAUSD whether Via Nueva Foundation itself will actually be operating the charter school Not only does the management agreement delegate or create the mechanism to delegate all charter schoolrelated operations management and administrative functions to Academica California but it gives Academica California control over significant areas including identifying and developing curriculum and coordinating student assessments without clearly explaining how the board will review and approve such actions Of additional concern to LAUSD is the fact that the management agreement specifically contemplates the delegation of authority to Academica California to offer preschool aftercare and earlycare programs as services ancillary but separate from the operations of the School which without clear explanation may allow for the commingling of public funds for the operation of a separate forprofit noncharter school related business Via Nueva has failed to submit any documentationinformation in or with the petition to evidence Academica Californias past and continued successful management administration of charter schools In fact during due diligence meetings with the Board President of the Via Nueva Foundation he informed LAUSD staff that while Academica California is to be affiliated with Academica Florida a charter operator in the state of Florida Academica California has not managed any charter schools previously and is staffed by only one person Ms Burton Via Nueva Academy and another school proposed by petitioners Porter Ranch Charter School would be the first schools that Academica California will have ever managed This is of particular concern to LAUSD considering that per the petition and Management Agreement which was submitted with Via Nuevas charter petition Academica California will have extensive responsibilities critical to the successful continued operation of the charter school A review of Via Nueva documents submitted to LAUSD indicates that all members of the Via Nueva Foundation board were recruited by an employee of Academica California a forprofit education management organization andor otherwise have a prior or existing relationship with an employees of Academica California The LAUSD staffs review of such documentation revealed that Academica California participated on an ongoing basis in Via Nuevas petition development and in turn the same Via Nueva Foundation board recruited by Academica California then contracted with Academica California to manage the proposed school Two members of the Via Nueva Foundation Board of Directors reside and work in the state of Florida calling into question whether these members will be able to engage in effective oversight and governance of the charter school located in California The petition fails to sufficiently describe the commingling of responsibilities and the fiscal relationship between the charter school and Pinecrest Academy a charter school located in Dade County Florida This is particularly troublesome considering one of the charter schools proposed board members is the Board Chair for Pinecrest Academy Inc and the Affiliation Agreement between the charter school and Pinecrest allows for the exchange of among other things financial resources between the parties without any specified checks and balances This raises concerns including the apparent potential for inappropriate and unrestricted gifting of California public education funds to Florida Via Nuevas onsite financial manager Mr Boland became associated with the charter school for the position of financial manager through a contact with an Academica Corporation employee from its Miami Florida office Via Nuevas Budget Plan submitted with its petition contains multiple fiscal problems including a b c d e The Budget Plan fails to include funding for all staff identified in the petition and fails to explain why there are no startup expenditures budgeted for staff The Budget Plan fails to provide documentation for loan financing Startup charters may not use CDE revolving loan in its budget planning The charter schools first year budget plan does not reconcile with its first year cash flow and Total of Cash Balance and Reserves in the Planning Budget for year does not reconcile with the year cash flow Rental Leases Repairs Series Breakdown in the Budget Plan does not match the charter schools Budget Plan The petition does not specify whether the affiliation agreement with Pinecrest Academy Inc in Florida has any associated costs chargeable to Via Nueva Regarding above The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all of the elements required in EC b based on the following findings of fact Description of the Schools Educational Program Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools educational program The enrollment projections from to of students is an amount which LAUSD staff believes is unjustified The petitioners have failed to submit documentation demonstrating proof of students meaningfully interested in attending the charter school and due to declining enrollment even startup charter schools are having difficulty reaching high enrollment projections The problem with the enrollment projections may be further compounded by the fact that in the same geographic area where the charter school proposes to operate LAUSD construction will result in the opening of two new middle schools SRMS SRMS and three new high schools SRHS SRHS and SRHS These schools will serve the same grade levels that Via Nueva proposes to target The charter schools program contains a daily academic schedule which includes unaccounted for time periods for students in grades and in comparison to the scope and sequence to demonstrate that a complete program is in place for these grade levels Governance Structure Element The petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools governance structure The comingling of responsibilities that will result from the management relationship between the Via Nueva Foundation and Academica California memorialized in a Management Agreement submitted with Via Nuevas charter petition calls into question whether Via Nueva Academy will be operated by the Via Nueva Foundation or Academica California For instance as reflected in Via Nueva Foundations Bylaws and the corporate information for Academia California both entities are located at the same address Devonport Lane Los Angeles California In addition Academica will be responsible for many duties that encompass the management and administration of the charter school including identification design and procurement of facilities staffing recommendations human resource coordination record keeping bookkeeping financial projections and statements grant solicitation annual reporting student assessment governmental compliance information systems development and curriculum development Because the duties and responsibilities of Academica are so extensive it is not clear from the petition and supporting documents whether Via Nueva Academy will be operated by the Via Nueva Foundation as stated in the petition or Academica California This raises concern about the Via Nueva boards fulfillment of its fiduciary responsibilities and the ability of LAUSD to exercise its oversight obligations All members of the Via Nueva Foundation board were recruited by an employee of Academica California a forprofit education management organization andor otherwise have a prior or existing relationship with an employees of Academica California This relationshipconnection between charter school board members and Academica California personnel not only may result in diminished board impartiality towards Academica California but may result in a situation where Academica California becomes the de facto charter school operator especially considering the level and type of services to be provided by Academica California Since LAUSD does not have a contractual relationship with Academica California with no ability to access its records the charter schools lack of independence from Academica California may limit the ability of LAUSD to exercise its oversight responsibilities over the charter school significantly increasing LAUSDs exposure to liability The petition fails to sufficiently demonstrate the relationship of the Via Nueva board to the leadership of the charter school in its organizational chart provided in the petition Specifically multiple positions referenced in the organizational chart submitted with the petition are not described in the petition itself The structure does not reflect an effective representation of interested parties in the proposed School Advisory Council This Council represents school personnel parents students business and community members The petitioners plan to have this Council appointed by the Board of Directors is not a process that results in effective representation or participation of the indicated groups in the selection of representatives Given the projected enrollment and numbers of school staff the quantity of members for the School Advisory Council also does not result in effective representation The petition fails to provide sufficient assurance that Via Nueva will comply with the Brown Act While the petition specifies that the charter school will comply with the provisions of the Brown Act the Via Nueva Foundation Bylaws allow the corporate Board to operate in a manner which may conflict with the Brown Act The petition fails to provide sufficient assurance that Via Nueva will comply with the laws against conflicts of interest While the petition specifies that the charter school will comply with the Political Reform Act and conflict of interest laws provided in Government Code section the Bylaws of the Via Nueva Foundation allow up to of the Board of Directors to be interested persons which may conflict with the restrictions of Government Code section et seq Similarly the Bylaws allow the Via Nueva Foundation to enter into a contract or transaction in which a director has a direct or indirect material financial interest Additionally the Bylaws specify that Directors may receive compensation for their services as established by resolution of the Board to be just and reasonable Director compensation is a material financial interest and as such the Board of Directors may not approve any action providing for their compensation without running afoul of conflict of interest statutes The petition fails to sufficiently state that Via Nueva andor its nonprofit corporation will be solely responsible for the debts and obligations of the charter school Such deficiency is of particular concern considering the fact that another organization Academica California appears to be primarily responsible for operating the charter school but does take responsibility for the debts and obligations of the charter school The petition fails to sufficiently acknowledge the charter schools obligation to promptly respond to all inquiries from LAUSD and to consult with LAUSD regarding any inquiries The petition fails to sufficiently acknowledge that the charter school is subject to audit by LAUSD including without limitation audit by the LAUSD office of the Inspector General The petition fails to sufficiently acknowledge the charter schools obligation to notify the LAUSD Charter Schools Division of the charter schools receipt of any notices of workplace hazards investigations by outside regulatory agencies lawsuits or other formal complaints The petition fails to sufficiently acknowledge the charter schools obligation to cooperate with LAUSD audits and inspections performed as part of the LAUSDs oversight responsibilities The petition fails to sufficiently describe the charter schools procedures for resolving student and employee complaintsgrievances related to the charter schools responsibilities under Title IX of the Education Amendments of and Section of the Rehabilitation Act of Employee Qualifications Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of employee qualifications The petition fails to acknowledge that all duties for Instructional Aides should be performed under the supervision of a certificated employee especially when supervising students during independent activities and supervising students at lunch and at recess The petition fails to properly acknowledge that the charter schools employee selection procedures shall not discriminate against applicants on the basis of race sex religion color national origin ancestry physical or mental disability medical condition statues as Vietnamera veteran or special disabled veteran marital status age and above sexual orientation or any other basis protected by federal state or local law or ordinance or regulation The petition fails to identify which specific administrator will be responsible for observation and evaluation of charter school teachers and fails to describe what Due Process will be afforded employees who disagree with an evaluation The petition fails to describe procedures it will follow for monitoring teacher credentials Petition does not contain job descriptions and qualifications of many positions on the organizational chart Health and Safety Procedures Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter schools health and safety procedures The petition fails to specify that Via Nueva will provide for the screening of pupils vision and hearing and the screening of pupils for scoliosis to the same extent as would be required if the pupils attended a noncharter public school The petition fails to include a sufficient assurance that Via Nueva will require immunization of pupils as a condition of school attendance to the same extent as would apply if the pupils attended a noncharter public school Annual Independent Financial Audits Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of annual independent financial audits The petition fails to include an assurance that the charter school will prepare and submit in the required format and within timelines to be specified by LAUSD each year budgets and reports including Provisional and Final Budgets First and Second Interim Projections Unaudited and Audited Actuals and Classification and Statistical Reports This is of particular concern since it is unclear whether the charter schools reporting and audit responsibilities will be delegated by the charter school to Academica California The petition fails to describe the plans and systems to be used by the charter school to provide information for an independent audit Page Financial Audits The petition erroneously states dispute resolutions in terms of audits The following statement should be deleted along with an anticipated timeline for the same Any disputes regarding the resolution of audit exceptions and deficiencies shall be referred to the dispute resolution process referenced in Element of this charter Suspension and Expulsion Procedures Element The petition does not present a reasonably comprehensive description of student suspension and expulsion procedures The petition fails to sufficiently describe Via Nuevas procedures by which pupils can be suspended or expelled including failure to address suspension appeal rights failure to specify all expulsion process timeframes and failure to sufficiently identify those school staff with authorityresponsibility for the various levels of discipline process The petition fails to sufficiently describe the discipline policies that will be in place at Via Nueva necessary to afford students adequate due process The procedures described in the petition regarding the rights of students with disabilities in regard to suspension and expulsion fails to conform with procedures which LAUSD has determined to be necessary and appropriate The petition fails to sufficiently address the readmission rights of students following expulsion Closure Procedures Element The petition does not include a reasonably comprehensive description of closure procedures The petition fails to describe closure procedures that are sufficient to ensure the proper disposition of all assets and liabilities of Via Nueva upon closure The petition includes content related to the dispute resolution process which may contradict charter closure procedures which the District has determined to be necessary and appropriate Los Angeles Unified School District Charter Schools Division CHARTER SCHOOL

and assessment tools to monitor Via Nueva Academys success at achieving these goals can be found in Element herein WHOM THE SCHOOL INTENDS TO SERVE If granted a five year charter Via Nueva Academy the proposed charter middlehigh school will be open to any student in grades through within the Los Angeles Unified School District who chooses to attend the charter school Via Nueva Academy an openenrollment public charter school intends to serve students living in the Southeast Quadrant of Los Angeles Maywood Huntington Park Vernon Bell and Southgate in LAUSD Board District Via Nueva Academy hopes to open in the city of South Gate but the specific site has not yet been chosen The location will be confirmed and all required approvals would be obtained within LAUSD guidelines prior to the school opening In the Southeast Via Nueva Academy will draw from a base of students who are from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds many of whom will likely be firstgeneration college students Thus the mission of Via Nueva Academy is to achieve a disciplined balanced and enriched education of the highest quality for its students through a framework of rigorous academic preparation community involvement and character education According to the Census South Gate has an estimated population of people inside of seven square miles making the density people per mile Nearly of the population is Hispanic and approximately are foreign born speaking little or no English Families constitute percent of all households with an average household size of persons Less than half of the population completed elementary school less than a quarter acquired high school equivalency and only percent completed a Bachelors Degree The Census identified the majority of the population as bluecollar and semi skilled workers in production transportation or office administrative occupations The Southeast is a large underserved urban community with primarily noncharter public schools that historically have been low performing andor overcrowded The area high schools serve a range of to students per campus with some operating multitrack year round calendars The Page Los Angeles Unified School District Charter School Application for Via Nueva Academy area middle schools are performing slightly better and serve a range of to students but continue to be program improvement schools Historically schools in this community have performed at API state rank of or and few are meeting Adequate Yearly Progress requirements Via Nueva Academy selected the community of South Gate because the founding group is specifically committed to educational reform in the Southeast Currently students in this community do not have the choice to attend a middle school with a statewide API of more than or or a high school with an API score of at least as evidenced by Table below Table Academic Performance Data of Surrounding Schools School Name API Score API State Ranking Independence ES

Charter School Application for Via Nueva Academy Table Via Nueva Academy Enrollment Projections GRADE Total As the chart above indicated the first year of operations Via Nueva will open up to seventy five students per a grade in th and th grade and twenty five students per grade in th and th grade The school will continue to expand its enrollment gradually adding a grade level each year until reaching a complete th through th grade program capacity The projected student increase for years will allow students already enrolled to continue the program while giving new students an opportunity to enroll in Via Nueva Academy Maximum capacity in will be with an estimated three hundred and seventy five students at the middle school and five hundred and seventy five students at the high school These are relatively small programs compared to the enrollment figures that currently exist in the surrounding public middle schools ranging from to students and high schools to students which are listed in Table above The enrollment targets were specifically drawn from feedback of community outreach efforts conducted by Via Nueva Foundation board members and volunteers over the past ten months There are about five to six very active organizations that focus specifically on issues related to education in this area including the Southeast Cities Schools Coalition comprised of elected officials and staff from all the Southeast cities Padres Unidos in South Gate PUMA in Maywood and Southeast Parents in Huntington ParkBell Via Nueva Academys outreach effort to these communities in the Southeast Los Angeles area Town Hall meetings through the Southeast Cities Coalition and the Maywood municipality have yielded significant feedback and support from parents educators and community Page Los Angeles Unified School District Charter School Application for Via Nueva Academy leaders Thus the enrollment projections reflect the significant interest from parents in the communities which the school will serve who will have children in these respective grades These enrollment projections are further based on the growth patterns of the successful school models researched by Via Nueva Academy see profiles on pp These models have all exceeded targeted enrollment projections after the first year of operation Additionally the gradual increase in enrollment will allow Via Nueva Academy to expand its programs at a controlled rate attain the viable number of students in order to offer a full range of extracurricular athletic and supplemental programs and still maintain a small school academic model A full range of student athletics and activities programs which are traditionally available in large high schools is vital to the models success in raising the selfesteem and academic interest of minority and underserved student populations Given the interest thus far it is expected that the program will continue to draw more students and parental interest upon proving its successful operation in year one Via Nueva Academy will continue community partnerships with such groups as the Southeast Cities Schools Coalition Padres Unidos PUMA and Southeast Parents in Huntington ParkBell to reach out to parents of underserved student populations in these areas in order to achieve its enrollment projections in subsequent years The racialethnic makeup of students in LAUSD Board District per Adequate Yearly Progress Reports is Hispanic White and other minority Free andor Reduced Lunch indicators reveal that of the overall population is economically disadvantaged Serving the students in the Southeast Los Angeles area Via Nueva Academy expects to have student population profiles similar to the surrounding public schools as described in Table below Table

Application for Via Nueva Academy Huntington Park HS South Gate HS Southeast HS Source CDE Growth Academic Performance Index API Chart School Demographic Characteristics Report DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE TARGET POPULATION See Appendix A Demographic Information for Prospective Site IDENTIFYING A FACILITY To provide ample time for construction of Via Nueva Academys permanent facility and meeting its opening Via Nueva Academy is considering various options in providing a temporary campus for its students With the additional time Via Nueva Academy will have about two years to complete construction of its permanent facility Via Nueva Academy anticipates completion of its permanent facilities and foresees occupancy in mid therefore staff and students with have minimal interruption and a seamless transition into the following school year The completion of the permanent campus will also allow enrollment to grow over the following years into its projected student population To alleviate the problem of finding a large facility during construction of its permanent facility Via Nueva Academy is planning to open with about two hundred students the first year For the first school year Via Nueva Academy will be housed in a facility suitable for approximately two hundred students with additional room to grow over the next school year Initially Via Nueva Academy would require approximately square feet of buildable space for necessary areas classrooms administrative space multipurpose room cafeteria and future expansion of core facilities for following years enrollment growth Currently there are four viable options that may house Via Nueva Academys campus for the first two years but may also accommodate growth into the fourth and potentially fifth school year The first two options are currently being used as retailoffice space and are readily available Additionally there are two more options that are currently being used as light industrialwarehouse space and are also readily available Since both of the light industrialwarehouse properties have been used Page Los Angeles Unified School District Charter School Application for Via Nueva Academy primarily for warehousing items the buildings are comprised mainly of open space and therefore must be built out to accommodate school facilities The properties contain square feet and square feet of usable space Due to the nature of use and size of each of these properties either option would require Via Nueva Academy to lease the entire property However both of these options allow for additional growth into the third year and therefore provide a longer solution All four options for Via Nueva Academys temporary campus are centrally located within the target area are easily accessible and pedestrian friendly The specific site for Via Nueva Academy will be confirmed and all required approvals would be obtained within LAUSD guidelines prior to the school opening EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY HOW THE OBJECTIVE OF ENABLING STUDENTS TO BECOME SELFMOTIVATED COMPETENT LIFELONG LEARNERS WILL BE MET BY VIA NUEVA ACADEMY Via Nueva Academys philosophy and educational methodologies are derived from researchbased strategies proven successful in raising student achievement across the nation At the heart of the Via Nueva Academys philosophy are two elements Academic Excellence and Character
