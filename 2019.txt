Resources is seeking Board approval to hire teacherson a Provisional InternshipPermit This action will ensure that all special education classrooms are staffed with contracted teachersOn December the Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC took action to discontinue the issuance of emergency permits Consequently all multiple subject single subject and educational specialist emergency permits expired as of June Notwithstanding that action the Commissionwas aware that there would be acontinuing need for a document that addressedunmet credentialing or staffing needs of school districts in California With the assistance and input from a broadbased group of statewide stakeholders it was determined at the time that anauthorization was still neededto staff classrooms when after a diligent search no appropriately credentialed teacher could be hired As a result the Commission developed the Provisional Internship Permit PIP The CTC Provisional Internship Permit is preferable to the formerly available emergency permit since the emphasis of this authorization is to prepare new teachers to enter accredited District or University Intern ProgramsThe Los Angeles County Office of Education grants authority to the District to employ potential Provisional Interns on a Temporary County Certificate until such time that the Board of Education approves their employment under the Provisional InternshipPermit Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC regulations require that the request to employ Provisional Interns be approved by the Board and submitted to the CTC within three months of the teacher beginning their assignment Requests to the Commission for a Provisional Internship Permit must include verification that a notice of intent to employ the applicant in the identified position was taken to the governing board The notice must include the name of the applicant the school site and a statement that the individual will be employed under a Provisional Internship Permit The CTC also requires that the approval of theseProvisional InternshipPermits be an action item on the agenda and not part of the Consent agenda Additionally the District must

renewal Petition application to the Charter Schools Division CSD seeking to renew its charter for a fiveyear term to serve up to students in grades TK in year one and up to students in grades TK by the end of the charter term Exhibit Community Preparatory Academy Renewal Petition CPA currently serves students in grades TK They are currently on two private facilities in Los Angeles and Carson at

if any CCR Doc III SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION Based on a comprehensive review of the renewal Petition other documentation submitted in the Petition application the schools record of performance information and documentation provided by or on behalf of CPA through the Districts oversight and publicly available information District staff recommends that the Board of Education deny the CPA renewal Petition and adopt these Findings of Fact In Support of Denial of the Charter Petition For Community Preparatory Academy based on the following grounds Petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the Petition Ed Code b The Petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements Ed Code b IV FINDINGS OF FACT IN SUPPORT OF DENIAL A PETITIONERS ARE DEMONSTRABLY UNLIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM Petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the educational program set forth in the Community Preparatory Academy renewal Petition Ed Code subd b Successful operation of a high quality charter school requires strong and consistent performance and compliance in academics governance operations and fiscal management Review of the Petitioner teams record of performance reveals numerous causes for concern in all of these critical areas Academic Performance and SB CPA has partially met the minimum renewal eligibility criteria and data by outperforming the Resident Schools Median in English Language Arts in the CAASPP SBAC schoolwide results [The California Department of Education has not identified Similar Schools for this school] However a close review of other academic data including most importantly subgroup performance data as required by SB does not overcome the governance operations and fiscal issues outlined in these findings of fact a Schoolwide Performance CPAs CAASPP SBAC results show levels of academic performance that are above the Resident Schools Median in English Language Arts ELA and below in Math Exhibit Community Preparatory Academy Data Set Doc CAASPP Assessment Percentage of Students who MetExceeded the Standards Community Preparatory Academy Resident Schools Median Similar Schools Median English Language Arts Math Further CPAs schoolwide comparative performance on the CAASPP SBAC from to reflects a percentage point increase of students who Met or Exceeded performance standards in ELA and an increase of percentage points in Math Exhibit Community Preparatory Academy Data Set b Student Subgroups Academic Growth When comparing the CAASPP SBAC data from to two of the three numerically significant subgroups African American and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged demonstrated increases in the percentage who Met or Exceeded standards in ELA and Math However while the Latino subgroup showed an increase of percentage points over three years in ELA this subgroup decreased in Math by percentage points over the same period of time See chart below Staff conducted a further analysis comparing CPAs Latino subgroups performance in Math to the Resident Schools subgroup Median which revealed the charter schools performance was percentage points lower than the Resident Schools subgroup Median Exhibit Community Preparatory Academy Subgroup Data Set Doc In conducting its review of the CPAs academic renewal factors the District has considered increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant the charter renewal The SB analysis of schoolwide and subgroup performance although showing some increases in ELA and Math does not lead to a recommendation of renewing the school based on the numerous critical concerns outlined below GOVERNANCE FISCAL AND OPERATIONS a Lack of Effective Governance The CSDs oversight records over the term of the charter have documented numerous governance issues including concerns related to compliance with the Brown Act provisions of due process and the CPA governing boards fulfillment of its role in actively governing and monitoring the schools educational program finances and operations Since CPA opened in the school has not earned a rating higher than Developing in the area of governance on its annual oversight evaluation reports See Exhibit Annual Oversight Reports Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses As described in further detail below CPAs repeated and ongoing failure to Numerous Notices of Concern and Notices to Cure were issued to CPA since The notices in this exhibit only include what is referenced factually herein in the findings of fact Doc respond adequately in a timely manner to District inquiries reflects a larger concern regarding the overall governance of the school On April the CSD met with CPAs Board President to discuss the ongoing concerns As exemplified throughout this report and following numerous communications with CPA the CSDs ongoing concerns remain Additionally responses to CSDs questions about these matters raise concerns about the accuracy of the organizations responses Furthermore subsequent to the April meeting additional issues arose including the suspension of corporate status and inaccurate furniture and equipment reporting both of which are explained below The recent suspension of the corporate status of CPAs operator illustrates the lack of active oversight and monitoring by its governing board CPA is governed and operated by Validation Academies Inc a California nonprofit public benefit corporation that does not operate any other LAUSDauthorized charter schools According to Validation Academies State of California Articles of Incorporation filed on December the specific purpose of Validation Academies is to provide advocacy consulting and management to K schools and to develop and operate public charter schools In September the CSD discovered that Validation Academies corporate status was in FTB Suspended status On October the CSD issued a Notice to Cure to CPA in order to inform its governing board that the California Secretary of State SOS and California Franchise Tax Board FTB websites were indicating that Validation Academies Inc was in FTB Suspended status See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses According to the SOS when a domestic entity is suspended [t]he business entitys powers rights and privileges which include the rights to use the entitys name in California [are] suspended or forfeited in California According to the FTB business entities such as Validation Academies Inc are suspended when they fail to file tax returns and neglect to fully pay taxes plus any other statutory amounts due On October CPA responded to the Notice to Cure stating that the FTB needed CPA to file the tax return which the school indicated was submitted to the FTB on October Validation Academies Incs corporate status has since reverted back to active status Notwithstanding this update to the corporate status of Validation Academies Inc CPAs response to the CSD was still incomplete because it failed to address the CSDs inquiry included in the October Notice to Cure that asked CPA to provide an explanation as to how long Validation Academies Inc has been in suspended status Given that the tax return triggering the FTB Suspended status pertains to calendar year this raises additional concerns as to the length of time Validation Academies Inc lost its rights powers and privileges to conduct business in California Furthermore the October Notice to Cure also requests a list of all contracts that have been entered into by Validation Academies Inc while in SOS andor FTB suspended CPA responded that there are no contracts to advise of However contrary to CPAs response the CSD found that on October while Validation Academies Inc was in suspended status CPA entered into a signed and executed services agreement with the Law Office of Philip Bucknor which is owned and operated by the spouse of CPAs Executive Director Exhibit Agreement for the Provision of Legal Services by The Law Offices of Philip Bucknor October According to the FTB Besides losing the right to conduct business another consequence of suspension or forfeiture is being subject to contract voidability for the period in which the entity is suspended or forfeiture The CSD informed CPA of this and according to CPAs Executive Director Nothing has been done with the contract since that time It may or may not be discussed Doc by School Leadership or the Board at a later date We dont have any other contracts to advise of See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses Throughout the term of the charter CPA has demonstrated a lack of organizational management Notices to Cure have been issued on the following issues the majority of which remain unresolved Minimally qualified credentialed teacher credentialing issues including misassignments and high ratio of substitutes and minimally developed systems of school health and safety operations See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses teacher development continued teachers and The concerns outlined in these findings of fact are compounded by the fact that Petitioners have a past history of involvement in charter schools which LAUSD regards as unsuccessful Pursuant to state regulations for purposes of Education Code section b the State Board of Education SBE shall take the following factor into consideration in determining whether charter petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program If the petitioners have a past history of involvement in charter schools or other education agencies public or private the history is one that the SBE regards as unsuccessful eg the petitioners have been associated with a charter school of which the charter has been revoked or a private school that has ceased operation for reasons within the petitioners control CCR Here Petitioners have been associated with operating a charter school which closed in CPAs Executive Director Ms Janis Bucknor was in a leadership position at a charter school Culture and Language Academy of Success CLAS or CLAS Affirmation which selfclosed on June after the school did not seek renewal for another fiveyear term Exhibit CLAS Board Resolution on selfclosure Within CLAS charter term the CSDs annual oversight report indicated that CLAS had an unsatisfactory rating of noting significant academic fiscal and governance issues Exhibit CLAS Annual Oversight Report Moreover CLAS also did not comply fully with closure procedures including submitting a final closeout audit as required in the charter Exhibit Letter to Philip Bucknor December The same pattern of failure to respond and compliance with the charter exists with CPA It is worth noting that when CPA Petitioners submitted their initial charter Petition and application to the CSD Ms Bucknor was not named in CPAs application packet However soon after the Board of Educations approval of the charter petition Ms Bucknor appeared as the Executive Director of CPA As noted throughout these CPAs organizational chart stated that the Executive Director is responsible for the overall management HR Fiscal and Operational of the school and reports to the governing board of CPA The Principal reports to the Executive Director As noted above Janis Bucknor was the Executive Director of the school On the September CPA governing board meeting the organizational chart was updated to reflect that Janis Bucknor is now the Coordinator of Outreach and Operations The Petition submitted also reflects the same Pursuant to the Petition the Coordinator of Outreach and Operations is responsible for managing the strategic plan of the organization including program compliance and community outreach works with the Governing Board to fulfill the schools mission oversees policies and procedures for the daytoday operation of the school serves as a liaison for purposes of community outreach and networking collaborates with school staff in all areas of operations for purposes of developing and implementing policies related to daytoday operational efficiency ensures compliance with all requirements related to submissions from the school to outside agencies reports to and may make recommendations to the Governing Board regarding matters within the scope of responsibility Has direct Supervisorymanagement responsibility for the Parent Engagement Coordinator Front Office functions and Community Activities and Networking Exhibit For the purposes of these findings of fact any reference to Executive Director pertains to Ms Bucknor since her role is still to oversee policies and procedures for the daytoday operations of the school Doc findings of fact the fiscal and governance issues noted in the annual oversight report for CLAS are also exhibited in the administration and operations of CPA b Fiscal Insolvency CPA is fiscally insolvent and has been operating at a net deficit since inception According to CPAs and annual independent audit reports and unaudited actuals the school ended each year with a negative fund balance Moreover CPAs financial difficulties have been exacerbated by its failure to meet its enrollment projections in each of the five years of its current charter term In the schools actual enrollment was approximately below its projected enrollment as noted in the table below c Ineffective Fiscal Management Since CPAs first year of operation in the school has consistently earned a rating of Unsatisfactory in the category of Fiscal Operations in the Annual PerformanceBased Oversight Visit Reports See Exhibit Annual Oversight Reports The school has a history of recurring issues and does not provide complete information and adequate responses in a timely manner Most recently on November as part of the annual oversight visit the CSD fiscal staff requested supporting documentation for a sample of financial transactions and again CPA did not provide the requested information by the prescribed deadline of November To date CPA has not provided all of the requested information CPA also has an established history of neglecting to adhere to its governing boardapproved fiscal and operating policies For example as indicated in CPAs Annual PerformanceBased Oversight Doc Year of OperationBeginning Net AssetsChange in Net AssetsEnding Fund Balance on June Based on CPAs Unaudited Actuals Report CPA Financial Position Per Annual Audit ReportYear of OperationProjected Enrollment per Approved CharterP Enrollment per California Department of Education Below Projected Enrollment Based on CPAs Month Enrollment Classification Report signed on November CPA Enrollment Projected versus Actual Visit Reports for two consecutive years CPA repeatedly made purchases with school funds without retaining proper supporting documentation such as itemized receipts Furthermore CPA has demonstrated ineffective fiscal management in other areas of operations which are described below i Lack of Internal Controls As part of the fiscal oversight review the CSD selected a sample of electronic debit transactions for further review and from this sample of these transactions approximately of the sample population lacked itemized receipts These unsupported electronic debit transactions totaled over in the aggregate and included purchases from several retailers including XLanes Etsycom Walmart Amazoncom iTunes and PayPal Per the schools fiscal policy receipts should be submitted to the Executive Director Site Administrator andor Board President for debit card purchases Exhibit CPA Fiscal Policies and Procedures The CSDs review of CPAs No Receipt Form for these unsupported transactions revealed that they were all signed and approved by Ms Bucknor This raised further concerns because Ms Bucknor was also identified as the purchaser for these transactions The No Receipt Forms provide no indication that they were reviewed or approved by CPAs Board President See Exhibit Missing Receipts Form ii Selling of Receivables Factoring On February Validation Academies Inc entered into an Agreement For The Sale Of Receivables with Charter Asset Management Fund LP CAM Based on CPAs factoring history with CAM from February through September ie over a month period CAM purchased a total of in receivables from CPA CAM funded a total of to CPA and as part of this factoring arrangement with CAM CPA incurred a total of in fees Despite the continued selling of receivables in its fifth year of operations the school remains fiscally insolvent which underscores the concerns regarding CPAs inability to properly manage its cash flow and meet its obligations Exhibit CPA Factoring Histories and Agreements iii Inaccurate Enrollment Reporting On February as part of the oversight visit at CPA the CSD fiscal staff conducted a student count and determined that there were a total of students students at the Carson site students at the Van Ness site and per CPAs Executive DirectorPrincipal students that were on a field trip that day However based on the Independent Charter School Classification Reports submitted and authorized by CPAs Executive Director on January pertaining to Month of the school year and February pertaining to Month the school reported an enrollment of students which reflects an overstatement of students based on the CSD fiscal staffs student count The CSD fiscal staff subsequently informed CPAs leadership team and its governing board President of this significant enrollment discrepancy The table below reflects the enrollment reported in the Independent Charter School Classification Reports submitted and authorized by CPAs Executive Director from September pertaining to Month through March pertaining to Month Doc On April CPAs Executive Director amended the Independent Charter School Classification Reports for Months through and reported revised enrollment figures of students for Months and Month and students for Month The table below reflects the corrected enrollment counts for these three months CPAs Independent Charter School Classification Report for Month indicated an enrollment count of students To date CPA has not submitted any amended Independent Charter School Classification Report for months prior to Month Doc GradeMonth Month Month Month Month Month Month K TKGrade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade TotalGradeMonth CorrectedMonth CorrectedMonth CorrectedMonth K TKGrade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade Grade Total iv Inaccurate Furniture and Equipment Reporting On November as part of the oversight visit at CPA the CSD Staff inquired about the significant decline in CPAs net property and equipment and other assets balance ie from per the audited actuals to per the unaudited actuals CPAs Executive Director stated that all items listed on the equipment inventory listing are either at the Carson school site or the Van Ness school site and that she would have to consult with the back office services provider regarding the current capital assets balance Given that CPA confirmed that all items disclosed on the equipment inventory listing were located at the two school sites the CSD fiscal staff then inquired about CPAs recurring payments to Public Storage Based on the CSDs review of CPAs check register from January through August ie over a month period CPA made a total of in payments to Public Storage According to CPAs check registers and a sample of Public Storage invoices these payments appear to be for at least five separate public storage units one of which has a dimension of feet by feet CPAs Executive Director stated that these Public Storage units were used to store furniture student desks and boxes of books However these items were not disclosed on CPAs equipment inventory listing During the November oversight visit the CSD fiscal staff requested permission to inspect the inventory of the items stored in these units However at that time CPAs Executive Director stated that she did not have the keys with her to access the storage units The CSD fiscal staff offered to return on either November or during the following week to inspect the inventory However approximately one week later on November CPAs Executive Director informed the CSD [via email] that we removed obsolete materials and otherwise consolidated various items of furniture and boxed materials into three units While CSD made the request to review the storage contents the CSD fiscal staff was never granted the opportunity to inspect the inventory of the items in the storage units prior to CPAs removal andor disposal of assets Subsequently the CSD requested that CPA provide A list of items that were removed sold andor disposed of from the Public Storage units and An updated fixed assets depreciation schedule for Fiscal Years through To date CPA has not provided these requested items v Questionable Forms of Payment to Vendors and CPAs Executive Director As part of CSDs oversight the CSD reviewed bank withdrawals for the selected months of October and December and ATM withdrawals for the months of July and August Through this review the CSD identified withdrawals that raised further questions On May the CSD issued both CPAs Oversight Report and a Notice to Cure which referenced these withdrawals which are summarized below Doc The withdrawals above were in the form of cash or cashiers checks and total in the aggregate According to CPAs fiscal policy the Purchase and Other Procurement section page states All purchases must be initiated by completing a purchase order or check request Exceptions may be granted by School Management Executive Director Site Administrator andor Board President for purchase of certain small items that are less than or in emergency situations Exhibit Fiscal Policies and Procedures However as reflected in the table above despite the fact that a majority of these vendor payments were over school management did not follow the proper purchase order or check request procedures when paying vendors Moreover on December was withdrawn from the schools bank account in the form of a cashiers check made payable to CPAs Executive Director Upon further inquiry CPAs Executive Director told the CSD that at the time there was an error with their payroll contractors payroll processing system and a cashiers check was issued to replace the payroll check issued by their payroll contractor The CSD has received no documentation to verify whether the governing board of CPA was aware of this cashiers check to CPAs Executive Director Further no information has been provided to the CSD to confirm either the voiding of the December cashiers check issued to CPAs Executive Director or the reimbursement to CPA by the payroll contractor for this error Further questionable transactions were discovered in the CSDs review of CPAs general ledger for Fiscal Year The CSDs review noted that check number dated August in the amount of was made payable to CPAs Executive Director This payment to

subsequently requested copies of all Forms W from CPA filed with the Internal Revenue Service for CPAs Executive Director and determined that for tax years and CPAs Executive Director received total wages of and respectively According to CPAs Board President for tax year CPAs Executive Director did not receive any wages and instead received a Form MISC that was filed with the Internal Revenue Service for CPAs Executive Director that reported other income of The CSD reviewed other transactions from CPAs bank statements and found that from December through February ie over a month period there were instances of in cash being withdrawn from CPAs checking account Exhibit Bank Statements and Withdrawals These cash withdrawals total in the aggregate According to CPAs Board President The nature of each transaction were made by staff for the following food for the after school program supplies for the office custodial supplies admission fees for activities transportation for field trips student uniforms meals school supplies for students and other related items As pointed out before due to inconsistent record keeping on our part We cannot provide the specific recipients of each transaction in years past However in the CSDs review of the GL Detail Report from CPAs back office services provider these cash withdrawals were all recorded in the general ledger with the description WITHDRAWAL No Backup for AP which indicates that no supporting documentation [such as itemized receipts and invoices] was provided to the back office services provider to validate the nature of these cash withdrawals The mere fact that none of these transactions have been supported with documentation especially in the context of the schools negative fiscal position raise significant concerns about the governance financial management and accounting of public funds vi State Tax Liens Against CPA A search of public records databases revealed that CPA has a number of liens Notably from October to April a period of months there were state tax liens filed in California against CPA The amounts range from to for a total of state tax liens One of the liens is in the amount of filed by the Employment Development Department Failure to pay taxes owed even for an amount as little as is another example of CPAs pattern of delinquent fiscal management Having state tax liens within this short time period of time further demonstrates ineffective fiscal management and fiscal accountability Exhibit Lien Filings d Potential Conflicts of Interest Furthermore of the above withdrawals the CSD identified a total of withdrawn from the schools checking account to purchase four cashiers checks which were made payable to The Center for Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning CRTL and Philip A Bucknor Philip A Bucknor is the CPA Executive Directors spouse Doc CRTL The CSD reviewed the public records for CRTL and found that on January CRTL filed its Articles of Incorporation with the California Secretary of State and similar to CLAS Inc Ms Janis Paxton aka Janis Bucknor is the named initial agent for service of process and signed as CRTLs Incorporator Exhibit CRTL Articles of Incorporation Further the CSDs research on CRTL revealed that the entity is in suspended status with both the SOS and FTB Considering that CPA is doing business with CRTL and CRTL is in a suspended status with both the SOS and FTB this calls into question the validity of all agreements by and between CPA and CRTL Exhibit CRTL Secretary of State search results On May the CSD issued a Notice to Cure requesting an explanation of the questionable transactions between CPA and CRTL and CPA doing business with a corporation in suspended status CSD cited the following provisions in the Notice to Cure Validation Academies Inc s Conflict of Interest Policy states A conflict of interest is present when in the judgment of the Board of Directors an insiders stake in the transaction is such that it reduces the likelihood that an insiders influence can be exercised impartially in the best interests of the Organization Furthermore CPAs Fiscal Policy dated June states l Authorization The Charter School Executive Director in conjunction with the Board President or Treasurer are responsible for overseeing the procurement process including establishment of procedures internal controls quality assurance methods of greatest economy and compliance with all applicable laws The official charter school expenditure budget is authorization for the executive director to make purchases within the budget under hisher control To be valid all contracts must be approved by the school board The school board may empower the executive director to enter into contracts that will be subsequently approved by the board Scope Purchasing procedures detailed in this section apply to procurement of equipment supplies and services used to support the educational process in excess of Purchases less than that amount are covered within other sections of this document Expenditure of charter school funds may only be for the public purposes of the charter school and may not benefit an individual A review of IRS Forms also indicate that Ms Bucknor is the Treasurer of CRTL The Forms indicate that she does not receive compensation from CRTL See Exhibit Forms Doc Cashiers Check DatePayeeAmountOctober CRTLOctober CRTLDecember CRTLOctober Philip A BucknorTotal In reviewing CPAs bank statements for the months of October and December the CSD determined that the payments to CRTL exceeded the threshold which according to CPAs Fiscal Policy should have been approved by CPAs governing board According to the Service Requirements For Responsive Teaching Classroom Workshop Series agreement between CRTL and CPA the agreement was signed by Ms Laura Hutto on behalf of CRTL on September and subsequently signed by the CPAs Executive Director on behalf of CPA on October Exhibit Contract with CRTL CPA did not present any evidence that the agreement was reviewed discussed and approved by CPAs governing board Instead in its response to the Notice to Cure CPA simply replied that CRTL was retained to provide professional development services and that it decided to cease doing business with CRTL See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses This response from CPA did not address the issues raised in the Notice to Cure Although the Forms do not declare that Ms Bucknor received compensation the fact that Ms Bucknor incorporated CRTL and continued to be an officer of that corporation raises questions pertaining to CPAs procurement processes and the CPA boards lack of oversight and accountability into the process for procuring services for the school While no documentary evidence is currently in the CSDs possession to speak to a possible financial interest in CRTL on the part of Ms Bucknor pursuant to the CPA governing boards own policy a conflict of interest is present when in the judgment of the Board of Directors an insiders stake in the transaction is such that it reduces the likelihood that an insiders influence can be exercised impartially in the best interests of the Organization Ms Bucknor by virtue of her role as the Executive Director of CPA is the very definition of an insider and has participated in the execution of the contract between the two parties in which she is is the Executive Director for one and a Board Treasurer for the other Exhibit Agreement between CPA and CRTL Philip Bucknor Regarding payments made to Philip Bucknor who is the husband of Ms Bucknor in their June response to the Notice to Cure CPA offered the following statement We believe that enough information has been provided regarding CRTL and Philip Bucknor as highlighted by the CSD to identify areas of concern and focus for CPA leadership and governing board As has been stated and discussed with CSD through direct conversation with CPAs Board President and conveyed through updates from CPA Leadership the issues raised with procurement services and payments to vendors or contractors are now an internal matter that CPAs governing board has responsibility for addressing At various times Philip Bucknor has provided legal services for CPA Those instances are both paid and pro bono Discussions concerning those services have taken place during board meetings wherein updates on the progress of legal matters have been given Reviews and approvals of matters concerning those services has also taken place Details of such can be found in the attached agendas and minutes Doc See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses First CPA through its response admits that it has at various times retained and paid Mr Bucknor as legal counsel California Government Code section and the Political Reform Act prohibit public officials from being financially interested in any contract made in their official capacity In this case as the Executive Director Ms Bucknor has a financial interest in her husbands receipt of payments from CPA The fact that Mr Bucknor may have occasionally provided pro bono services to CPA is immaterial The fact remains that Mr Bucknor has received payments for legal services from CPA and is on official retainer to do so See Exhibit Agreement for the Provision of Legal Services by The Law Offices of Philip Bucknor October The California Fair Political Practices Commission the nonpartisan commission that has primary responsibility for the impartial and effective administration of the Political Reform Act has issued an opinion that income includes the officials community property interest in his or her spouses income In re Cory FPPC Ops In addition California Government Code section prohibits an officer or employee from entering into a contract in which he or she is financially interested An official has an interest in the community and separate property income of his or her spouse Nielsen v Richards CalApp Thorpe v Long Beach Community College Dist CalAppth CPAs reply does not explain away the conflict of interest CPAs statement that it is now an internal matter that CPAs governing board has responsibility for addressing is nonresponsive and contrary to the recently executed legal services agreement with The Law Offices of Philip Bucknor Exhibit e Petitioners have presented an unsound financial and operational plan for the proposed charter school The Petitioners propose that the enrollment rollout plan for Fiscal Years and is and students respectively However given CPAs history of actual enrollment being significantly below projected enrollment for all five years of its current charter term this presents concerns about the Petitioners ability to meet these enrollment projections during the next five years This also calls into question the reasonableness of the Petition budget which relies on the enrollment projections to derive the average daily attendance Doc Year of OperationProjected Enrollment per Approved CharterP Enrollment per California Department of Education Below Projected Enrollment Based on CPAs Month Enrollment Classification Report signed on November CPA Enrollment Projected versus Actual Further the Petition budget organizational chart and job descriptions are inconsistent based on the following information The job positions stated in the Organizational Chart Element Employee Qualifications Element and the Petition budget are inconsistent The Petition does not include job descriptions and minimum qualifications for all job positions The Petition states The Board of Directors will evaluate the Executive Director page However the Executive Director position is not listed under Element Element and is not reflected in the Petition budget f Persistent Failure to Respond to Inquiries Education Code section requires a charter school to respond promptly to the reasonable inquiries of its authorizer the county office of education with jurisdiction over its charter authorizer and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ed Code This requirement serves the important public interest in ensuring that independent charter public schools remain transparent and accountable to the public officers under whose jurisdiction and control they operate See Ed Code Moreover it is critical to the success of the charter school oversight process that a charter public school and its authorizer communicate and interact in a professional manner Since CPA opened in it has repeatedly failed to respond adequately in a timely manner to District requests for information and documentation In its first year alone the school failed to respond promptly and adequately to District inquiries into issues in critical areas such as failure to submit monthly retirement reports and contributions to CALSTRS fiscal condition and inadequate fiscal policies and procedures failure to submit P reports hiring of nonNCLB compliant teachers failure to obtain timely TB clearances failure to obtain timely DOJ clearances violation of certificate of occupancy from one of its sites and high student suspension rates See Exhibit Notices to Cure and Responses The school has continued this pattern up to and into the current school year As stated above as recently as December the CSD issued a Notice to Cure regarding the organizations suspended FTB corporate status Further at the recent oversight visit CPA refused to provide a reasonable explanation regarding the furnishings and the amount paid to Public Storage

provide a rationale for projected enrollment increases eg fifth graders becoming sixth graders the next year Petition description on LCFF does not outline how it would address the needs of all numerically significant subgroups such as socioeconomically disadvantaged or African American regarding CAASPP ELA scores The Petition also does not address Foster Youth as a potential subgroup Petition fails to designate other areas of study as core or noncore eg arts Petition fails to describe intervention and enrichment programs Petition does not include a description of its TK program There is an inconsistency between the academic calendar The Petition lists the academic calendar as days not days as claimed and based on the calendar error the instructional minutes are incorrect Petition fails to describe how the school will recruit qualified teachers which is especially important in light of the schools high substitute rate and credentialing issues Petition does not adequately describe how it will identify and serve gifted students Element Governance Petition inconsistently provides that board members are elected for oneyear terms p and that bylaws provide board members shall serve up to twoyear terms p while Bylaws Article Art C provides for twoyear terms While provision under the sections titled Conflict of Interest in the Petition p and Validations Academy Inc VCI bylaws Section both state that Governing Board shall adopt a Board Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with the provisions of Government Code Section et seq both the Conflict of Interest Policy and Code submitted for review do not address compliance with Government Code section et seq pursuant to the Districts Charter Authorizing Policies and Procedures For reasonably comprehensive findings please see Exhibit Community Preparatory Academy Renewal Petition Doc The organizational chart p does not adequately depict the supervisorial advisory and other relationships among and between the Charter School its nonprofit corporation and governing board committees key personnel and parentstakeholder councils For example the operating entity is not indicated in the chart and the position of the school Principal and the schoolsite council are not included in the chart The Petition does not describe the process by which the school will consult with parents and teachers regarding the schools educational program Brown Act Inconsistent with the requirements of the Brown Act Government Code section b VCIs bylaws Section E provide that regular or special meetings of the board may be held within or outside the State of California The Brown Act requires that all regular and special meetings be held within the boundaries of the territory over which the Board has jurisdiction As a charter school authorized by LAUSD the jurisdictional boundary applicable to the charter board is that of LAUSD The Charter School would be in violation of the Brown Act should it hold a board meeting outside the state of California The bylaws do not describe per the Brown Act Government Code section b the other criteria that must be present in order for the governing board to hold a meeting by teleconference The bylaws do not include the timeline for notice giving for special meetings of the board The bylaws allow the board to take action without a meeting with the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of the board of directors as long as members of the board consent in writing to that action Board action outside of meeting is prohibited as it eliminates participation of the public and is therefore inconsistent with the open and public meetings intent of the Brown Act SB which became effective January and amends the Open Meeting Act eliminates a Boards ability take action without a meeting While Section G provides that directors shall receive no compensation for their service subsection Gb states that Committees shall have all the authority of the board except that among others no committee may fix the compensation of board members for their service The provision is redundant and may be interpreted to mean that board members may receive compensation if it is approved by the board and not a committee If the latter is the case this may run contrary to conflict of interest laws including Govt Code et seq and LAUSD COI policy Bylaws do not explicitly provide that meetings and actions of committees shall comply with the Brown Act Section H Doc Section of the bylaws provides that Governing Board shall adopt a Board Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with the provisions of Government Code Section et seq However subsection a includes a statement that directors would be furnished as part of the annual report with statement of any transaction in which i in which the corporation or its parent or subsidiary was a party ii in which an interested person had a direct or indirect material financial interest and iii which involved more than or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving in the aggregate more than This monetary threshold is high given that the Political Reform Act considers a public official to have a financial interest in a source of income when the official has received or was promised to receive a total of or more in the months prior to the decision at issue Furthermore this Section assumes that a transaction in which a director has a material financial interest may be approved by the Board Element Employee Qualifications Element does not identifylist all Charter Schools employee classespositions including administrators certificated staff instructional support staff and classified staff It is unclear what positions make up the functions in cells titled Community Activities Networking or the Staffing and Program Support in the organizational chart in Element on page of the Petition For the positions included in Element Petition does not provide comprehensive job descriptions and the disciplinefield of study of the desirable qualifications Further the responsibilities for the positions of Director of Outreach and Operations and the Director of Curriculum and Instruction are not clearly delineated Element Health and Safety Procedures Element does not comprehensively describe how the Charter School will support and promote the health and wellness of its students Element Admissions Requirements Element does not identify the open enrollment periods or timeline for the Charter School or how will this be communicated to interested families Petition fails to include the rationale for providing the admission preferences listed in Element or specify the priority order for the preferences Element fails to describe procedures that the Charter School will follow to determine waiting list priorities based upon lottery results Petition does not include language in accordance with AB enacted on October that the schools nondiscrimination provision shall prohibit the Charter School from requiring Doc a parent legal guardian or student to provide information regarding immigration status for enrollment and admissions process Element Annual Financial Audits The Petition states on page that the School Directors will ensure that the annual audit will be completed and forwarded to the District however Elements or do not include any such identified position It is therefore uncertain what position at the Charter School has this responsibility for working with the independent auditor to complete the audit and for ensuring that the independent auditor sends the completed audit to the required agencies by the statutory deadline Element Suspension and Expulsion Procedures Petition does not contain the statement or address other requirements in accordance with Education Code bJiii that No pupil shall be involuntarily removed by the charter school for any reason unless the parent or guardian of the pupil has been provided written notice of intent to remove the pupil no less than five schooldays before the effective date of the action Petition does not describe the Charter Schools Restorative Justice practices that will be used to build community and repair harm done to relationships The Charter Schools process for implementing inschool suspension is not comprehensively described It is unclear what positions at the Charter School isare authorized to suspend and expel students For example the Petition states that [s]tudents will be recommended for expulsion if the Executive Director finds that however per contents in Elements and the Charter School does not have the position of Executive Director Petition does not indicate the maximum number of days students with Individualized Education Programs may be suspended within one academic year Element does not address the specific rules and procedures for suspension pending the outcome of an expulsion process neither does it specify the maximum number of days a suspension can be extended or the Charter Schools interim placement procedures including how and where students will have meaningful access to education during the term of the suspension pending the outcome of an expulsion process Element Closure Procedures Petition fails to identify the specific positions that will serve as the Charter Schools closure agents in the event that the Charter School closes Doc V RECOMMENDATION Based on the foregoing Staff recommends that the Petition be denied for the following reasons it is demonstrably unlikely that the Petitioners will successfully implement the program set forth in the Petition and the Petition does not contain all reasonably comprehensive descriptions required in a charter In review of the Charter Schools Petition and in compliance with SB the District has considered increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor in determining whether to grant the charter renewal As stated in the comments to SB This bill specifies that a charter authorizer must consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the school as measured by the [Academic Performance Index API] as the most important factor for renewal and revocation This does not mean the charter school is automatically not renewed or revoked but it does mean that the charter authority must consider this information as the most important factor in making its decision In other words the charter authority must give extra weight to this factor when it considers all the factors for renewal or revocation The District has also considered the schools past performance in the areas of the academics finances governance leadership and operations in evaluating the likelihood of future success along with future plans for improvement if any as required by state regulation Throughout the term of the charter CPA has been provided with numerous opportunities to address all the issues As noted above CPA has not resolved numerous issues in spite of the Notices to Cure and requests for response Further many responses have been either nonresponsive or inadequate The likelihood of future success in implementing a successful program based on this schools leadership and governance history has not been demonstrated by the petitioners As discussed above although a review of CPAs academic schoolwide and subgroup performance showed some increases in ELA and Math weighing the partial increases in subgroups performance versus the serious fiscal and governance concerns outlined herein in the Findings of Fact for nonrenewal does not lead to a recommendation of renewing the school VII CONCLUSION In order to deny the Petition on the grounds set forth above Education Code section subdivision b requires the Board to make written factual findings specific to the particular Petition setting forth specific facts to support one or more grounds for denying the Petition Should the Board decide to deny the Petition District Staff recommends that the Board adopt these Findings of Fact as its own Doc Exhibit RENEWAL

choice for grades K to in a multifaceted learning environment Based on the most recent CAASPP Data provided for Community Preparatory Academy our scholars have increased their scores outperforming the local District schools as evidenced in the Data Set provided in the Appendices We have grown from a population of in to a population of in serving students in grades K Our school locations have changed since our opening in creating a shift in our demographic population but we have seen a steady increase in scores and have been able to successfully reclassify English Learners and meet the needs of our subgroups In reviewing the and CAASSP performance data for Community Preparatory Academy on the California Department of Education CDE online data repository for the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress CAASPP httpscaasppcdecagovsbdefault the school demonstrated overall schoolwide performance growth in English Language Arts ELA and Mathematics Math each year outperforming the resident schools This year we did experience a numerically insignificant dip on our scores for our Latino subgroup which we attribute to students who were identified Latino and with Disabilities The actual number of those students affected being In addition we identified three of our students as Long Term English Learners and we are working with those students daily To that end we have changed some of the instructional practices in the classrooms to ensure we are targeting those students We are using a combination of different written scaffolds and visuals to help provide additional support for targeting our EL students The first thing that we are doing is ensuring that our students have ample time to discuss information and creating the structures for students to connect new information with past experiences Connecting information to personal cultural and world experiences builds students comprehension skills Also connecting cultural information helps students understand that their culture is valued in our school thereby allowing the student more potential to share and build inside the curriculum We have pushed teachers to increase their use of visuals and graphic organizers We have found that the increase of graphic organizer use has helped students keep their writing organized and the increase of visuals has helped with comprehension of academic text and directions We have also learned that the increase use of graphic organizers has helped tremendously with the speaking and listening skills We have transitioned to a great deal of speaking and listening in the classrooms We have and will continue to teach teachers how to build checking for understanding questions that give students opportunities to discuss grade level content Lastly we have embraced preteaching vocabulary words Increasing student vocabularies is key to reading comprehension we do so again with the use of visuals and graphic organizers One method in particular that we use is the Frayer model which forces students to use the vocabulary word in context illustrate a picture of the word and display the dictionary definition along with the student built definition We will continue to provide designated and integrated EL classes to ensure our students have access to the language skills that will make them proficient English speakers We couple these classes with targeted intervention During these targeted intervention periods we begin with decoding CVC words and transition to L and R blends Additionally we push three types of reading in these classes These intervention classes vacillate text and use a combination of fiction and nonfiction Internally we use three mechanisms to track grade level data We use Iready Study island and internally group built assessments I ready does shows us a couple different looks The first it shows our grade level data and how each student is doing compared to the mean Study island provides meaningful rigorous content that we are able to customize it also provides a interactive features that keep students attention while rewarding learning and displaying achievement Lastly our groups of teachers build unit interim assessments and nontraditional interim assessments that ensure we are developing students soft skills Each of our lower grades take all of the above tests to ensure our students are on the right track We attribute the success of our program to the consistency in assessing and the core curriculum selected Our students are given diagnostic testing in ELA and Math four times during the academic year Teachers use the data from these assessments to guide instruction and create individualized learning plans The data is also used to formulate small groups for after school intervention andor enrichment All students are enrolled in an online platform that allows for growth monitoring as well as creating lessons specifically to meet the students need whether that is to intervene for students scoring below grade level or advance a student who is already scoring at or above grade level One of our subgroups Students with Disabilities has not been identified with test scores for the third year in a row the first three years were because the population of students with disabilities was numerically insignificant However last year we had a population of eighteen Students with Disabilities of which fifteen were in grades Out of those fifteen students parents of six of those students requested in writing that we not test those students This again brought us to a numerically insignificant amount This year we have Students with Disabilities and expect to see scores for this subgroup STUDENT POPULATION TO BE SERVED Community Preparatory Academy seeks to serve those families attending neighborhood schools who are proactively seeking change in public education as well as to attract those families that have chosen to not enroll their children in our neighborhood schools and currently attend private or parochial schools There are many families with experiences and resources to share with schoolage children in terms of mentorship volunteering and who otherwise want join in to make a needed change in our local neighborhoods What Community Preparatory Academy offers a K program which restores high expectations and academic achievement for all A quality educational program would no doubt attract local areas families back to public schools and help rebuild our local communities Community Preparatory offers an arts enrichment program as well as coding in grades K While we cannot with accuracy predict enrollment for each year for purposes of planning budgets and operations conservatively within the context of the requested revision and noted changes the following are our enrollment projections for the next five years K TOTAL GOALS AND PHILOSOPHY School Vision Community Preparatory Academy will achieve academic and cultural excellence for all students by meeting the students where they are culturally and linguistically in order to meet the demands of becoming a st century learner prepared for success at the university in a career and for lifelong learning School Mission Enable students to become lifelong learners informed and responsible citizens competent and successful members of the workforce thinking fulfilled and caring individuals Develop leaders for the st century who have a wellrooted culturally based selfconcept as autonomous productive lifetime learners who are connected to the global community Equip and empower students to become leaders by establishing a wholechild mindset that every student has genius and everyone can be a leader AN EDUCATED PERSON IN THE ST CENTURY In addition to covering the Common Core curriculum Community Preparatory Academy incorporates options for innovation and creativity in the arts technology and other enrichment experiences We believe that students need schools to prepare them in terms of college and careerreadiness for the future which is already incredibly technology driven To be successful in their rapidly changing environment student must add to the basics of fundamental academic skills the need to Evaluate and use information rather than simply memorizing facts They must develop critical thinking collaborative work habits and problem solving and technology skills This is essential in a world where information is currently estimated to double every years and where the traditional manufacturing sector is being replaced by a growing service sector and higherskilled industries The US Labor Department states that a large percentage of the jobs available to our future graduates have not yet been invented Flexibility and the ability to adapt will be essential in the outlook of students stepping into their future Build a deeper understanding of the logic and processes of science and engineering that will enhance students ability to make informed decisions about the environmental medical and ethical issues they will face as responsible citizens Learn and practice better exercise and eating habits and build a deeper understanding about personal and public health issues and how they affect their lives Develop the positive socialemotional skills that are paramount to developing healthy satisfying personal relationships and successful workplace relationships The emotional health of many urban students is under constant siege in neighborhoods marked by a weakened social fabric and families battling multiple stressors such as violence racism and economic deprivation It is essential that students graduate having the coping skills associated with more vibrant social participation It is essential that students develop and experience a sense of agency and responsibility for making their world a better place through personal action in their own communities and beyond Appreciate and participate in the arts discovering the joy and personal power in artistic expression Such practice is recognized as helping to develop and sustain curiosity wonder and creativityall essential to developing the mental agility and willingness to adapt in the face of rapidly changing situations Understanding the arts also leads to increased knowledge about the world and its people enabling them to appreciate the richness and vibrancy of other countries and cultures Learn and work autonomously in order to independently advance themselves by continuing their education and developing new skills on a lifelong basis Whether college bound or interested in vocational training there is a place for every student to be prepared to experience and demonstrate personal responsibility and success in their chosen path We believe using Community Preparatory Academys three distinct learning components an educated person in the st century will have the following characteristics and skills which we call ACT Academic Excellence Through a studentcentric lens and a caring supportive school culture Community Preparatory Academy will promote a rigorous academic discipline with the highest expectations for every student to be excellent in every way Cultural Appropriateness Realizing that success in mainstream culture and academia is related to a level of cultural and linguistic acceptance Community Preparatory Academy will explicitly teach the norm mores and expectations of the society at large while at the same validating and affirming the home or indigenous cultures and languages of our students for the purpose of building and bridging them to those expectations Technology Driven Moving beyond the use of technology as a means to access instructional material to the use of technology as a mode of instruction Where all students use technology to synthesize instructional materials and resources communicate with their instructors and each other develop and create original content have immediately intervention and enhancement of academic progress through the collection and sharing of data enabling the specific tailoring of interventions and enrichment options and are otherwise supported in expanding their learning across the curriculum Community Preparatory Academy intends to transform how students learn through innovation with learning options to meet the needs of all students HOW LEARNING BEST OCCURS Based on the premise that the institution of schooling in the US has underserved many populations historically primarily African American and Latino students Community Preparatory Academy will provide a researchbased response to this persistent and disproportionate failure In general Community Preparatory Academy follows six learning pillars that best demonstrate how learning occurs Summary of Learning Best Pillars Pillar Description Responsiveness Premises that when students are validated and affirmed based on their cultural and linguistic backgrounds they are able to thrive academically socially and behaviorally in the school setting Highest Expectations Challenging achievement requirements for all students including a failure is not an option mindset Resource Access Highest

INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN Community Preparatory Academy follows the California state frameworks Common Core Standards and Next Generation Science Standards ensuring that students develop competence in skills and mastery of standards for each grade level Additionally curriculum is taught strategically in a sequential manner to ensure that students master particular skills and knowledge at designated points in time building early skills as the foundation for more complex higherorder skills and knowledge To assess development the core curricular area assessments are administered frequentlyat the beginning of a unit of study throughout the unit of study and at the end of the unit of study measuring student progress toward mastery of the standards and to inform teacher instructional methods and intervention strategies Essential to our instructional program are the following principles Introduce new information in manageable and sequential units Identify prerequisite skills and build on the prior knowledge of the learner Allocate sufficient time to attain essential skills Review previously taught skills Administer ongoing assessment to inform instruction Provide immediate intervention strategies for those students who are not progressing toward the standards Engage in accountable talk where teachers and students press for clarification and explanation require justifications of proposals and challenges recognize and challenge misconceptions demand evidence for claims and arguments interpret and use each others statement The foundation for Community Preparatory Academys instructional program is grounded in our setting of a collaborative learning environment This supports our curriculum program by providing an interactive projectbased approach which engages students at a deeper level of interest Multiple SubjectSingle Subject or Intern credentialed teachers will be assigned to selfcontained classrooms in grades K working collaboratively We believe that all children can meet and exceed state standards when they are given high expectations and an individualized supportive environment in which to excel A collaborative learning environment declares that everyone is a learner In this environment there is a passion for teaching and learning Teachers become facilitators who know their students talents prior school experiences and needs This knowledge enables teachers to respect where they are coming from in order to support further learning For true collaboration to take hold teachers must create a learning environment that is emotionally intellectually and psychologically safe where learners can acknowledge what they do not know take risks and reflect and revise what they know and what they choose to do Collaboration promotes social and emotional intelligence as students work together Most importantly collaborative learning is about exploring the unknown together beginning with an abundance of questions that challenge assumptions and spark lively discussions It requires active listening careful observation of how individuals are responding and leaving space for silence that can often lead to great discoveries Lastly a collaborative learning environment allows everyone to learn how to think on his or her own interpret information and think through problems CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION Community Preparatory Academy will implement curriculum based on proven models of education such as Resnicks Principles of Learning constructivism projectbased learning a balancewhole child approach and intensive family involvement It is important to note that explicit instruction of basic skills the presentation of factual information and intensive intervention for struggling learners also occupies important roles in our balanced instructional approach We believe that a deep foundation of standards based factual knowledge is necessary to develop accurate understanding of complex concepts Consequently the explicit teaching of facts information and skills plays an important role in developing student comprehension and content mastery across each academic discipline literacy program in EnglishLanguage Arts A balanced CORE EnglishLanguage Arts Curriculum Overview Community Preparatory Academy proposes to implement a balanced literacy approach to includes instruction read alouds reading to students shared reading reading with students guided reading reading in small groups independent reading reading by students literature circlesbook clubs sharedinteractive writing and independent writing word study phonemic awareness Included is a conference approach between student and teacher and between peers to the learning of reading and writing The intent is to understand a learners individual abilities and misconceptions in these areas in order to provide instruction towards meeting grade level standards CPA also recognizes that literature is a necessary component in any balanced literacy program Therefore the School plans to provide ample high quality classroom libraries for student use and teacher instruction Literacy curriculum is congruous with the English Language Arts California state standards Community Preparatory Academy teachers will implement a comprehensive balanced approach to literacy allocating a daily block for each classroom K The balanced literacy program is composed of SSR Writing Workshop Instruction for Phonics primary grades Vocabulary and Spelling For those students receiving intervention additional time is allocated in the afternoons one on one or pullout support after school tutoring or at home specific athome suggestions as provided by the classroom teacher in the area of literacy Community Preparatory Academy currently uses McGraw Hill Wonders in grades K and Houghton Mifflin Collections in grades as the nucleus of its EnglishLanguage Arts program English Language Development designated and teachers implement integrated Community Preparatory Academy instruction time for English Language learners Students receive time each day specifically designed to address their needs We have adopted the LAUSD Master Plan for English Learners and have selected the Wonders ELD curriculum to facilitate learning for our integrated ELD and students Only California Wonders seamlessly designated ELD instruction with connected instruction and resources This connectedness provides English Learners with equitable access to rigorous content in meaningful contexts The Wonders for English Learners curriculum is connected to the core Wonders ELA program scope and sequence so that all students share the same weekly content but focused on language production The program includes integrates ELA Targeted instruction for Emerging Expanding and Bridging students Adaptive learning to target support for studying foundational skills Structured opportunities to practice and apply academic language Focus on interpretive collaborative and productive modes of communication CORE Mathematics Curriculum Overview Key features in Community Preparatory Academys approach to the teaching of mathematics include problem solving for everyday situations developing readiness through handson activities establishing links between past mathematical experiences and explorations of new concepts sharing of ideas through discussion cooperative learning through partner and small group activities practice through games ongoing assessment and a homeschool partnership Common Core Standards in the area of Mathematics for the grade levels served will guide content addressed Teachers will create a math workshop environment where students receive instruction from the teacher in small groups and have ample time to work independently on refining their basic skills such as addition subtraction multiplication and division Community Preparatory Academy will provide mathematics instruction every day For Elementary students the MY Math Curriculum provides the content needed for our students In Middle grades we use an online platform called Apex Learning In addition all students in grades K have access to ST Math and iReady My Math Community Preparatory Academy proposes to utilize My Math as the nucleus of its mathematics program in kindergarten through fifth grade Teachers will engage students with math applications in small students gradelevel groupings Throughout small group instruction the teacher uses various learning techniques to engage different types of learners The teacher uses manipulatives to help the students go from abstract to concrete thinking and understanding Additionally small white lapboards are used during small group instruction to engage with the students in an interactive math group This enables both the teacher and the students to quickly monitor their understanding of the mathematical concept and reteach as necessary The teachers engage the students in discussions about mathematics During the lesson students engage in handson practice while the teacher circulates around the small groups interacting with the students checking for understanding and reteaches the concept when necessary The content covered corresponds with the grade level standards and the specific activities used to address the standards are multileveled Apex Learning Community Preparatory Academy proposes to utilize Apex Learning as the nucleus of its mathematics program in grades six through eight This curriculum gives students concentrated practice in basic skills while continuing to deepen their critical thinking skills All middle school students have math instruction each day and for those students who need additional instructional time a block of math time is provided weekly through block scheduling The middle school math curriculum will continue to fulfill the necessary components of mathematics as set forth by the California Framework Direct systematic instruction in arithmetic prealgebra and algebra are covered The School will offer the recommended and required algebra courses for seventh and eighth grade students to ensure advanced mathematics courses are taken in high school The instructional approach is systematic so that there is coherent understanding to the ascending levels of math CORE HistorySocial ScienceHumanities Curriculum Overview The California History Social Science Framework delineates three Goals and Curriculum Strands that bridge the grade levels K Goal of Knowledge and Cultural Understanding Goal of Democratic Understanding and Civic Values and Goal of Skills Attainment and Social Participation At each grade level these strands are represented by state standards At the K level teachers use real literature and primary sources to teach and to inform understanding of the grade level standards and at the grade level they use textbooks as resources real literature critical essays and primary sources to inform understanding at teach the gradespecific standards Community Preparatory Academy utilizes TCI as the nucleus of its History Social Science and Humanities program in grades K CORE Science Curriculum Overview The NGSS calls for a threedimensional approach to K science instruction This represents a significant transition from previous state standards Thats why effective implementation demands a great deal of collaboration and patience to Community Preparatory Academys implementation enables our teachers to inspire future generations of scientifically literate students Community Preparatory Academy believes that science is an active thinking focused enterprise coordinated approach thoughtful and We believe that scientific knowledge advances when learners observe objects and events think about how they relate to what is known test their ideas in logical ways and generate explanations that integrate the new information into an established order Thus the scientific enterprise is both what we know content and how we come to know it process CPA contends that the best way for students to appreciate the scientific enterprise to learn the essential and necessary scientific concepts and to develop the ability to improve scientific thinking is to actively construct ideas through their own The school utilizes Inspire Science as the nucleus of its Science program Arts Curriculum Overview Community Preparatory Academys art education will be a schoolwide K arts program which implements standardsbased arts instruction in visual or performing arts on a weekly basis Instruction and exposure to a variety of arts disciplines are vital to a childs education providing a common core of knowledge that helps students appreciate and understand history and cultures develop critical and creative thinking and aids them in problemsolving and selfesteem Methods of arts instruction are based on experiential reflective child centered activities Students are challenged to understand the language history and context of the visual arts and to link art with larger social and historical developments We invite students to explore the power and impact of the visual image as a new language They analyze the work of various artists evaluate the message and impact of those works and understand how those works built upon or were counter to the philosophical and artistic ideas prevalent at the time the art was created CPAs Arts Program is sound and successful with the support and direction of all stakeholders that allows for parent and staff collaboration to guide arts instruction at the School Technology CPA recognizes that technology is an integral part of our world today and computers and other technology should not be viewed as addons but as tools that are a vital part of a childs learning experience The school will utilize technology as a learning tool to help students find evaluate organize synthesize and communicate information Technology enriches our workshopbased approach supports inclass learning and is an essential tool for teaching information literacy critical thinking independent and lifelong learning and social responsibility Computers are the perfect tools for engaging students as selfdirected learners and problem solvers Technology also has the ability to empower students by offering them access to real data and authentic problems to work through With the enormous amount of available information today CPA recognizes it is imperative that students learn how to be information managers rather than an information collector We implement a studentcentered online community where each student has their own blog for posting their own multimedia work and inclass writing samples and publications Students are able to join online discussions led by teachers or other students To connect with our larger mission technology is used to foster independent learning offer individualized instruction provide interactive handson experiences and support our interdisciplinary thematic framework and teach important skills necessary to succeed in the st century CPA will ensure that students will be prepared and equipped to take computerbased state standardized assessments by having provided regular exposure and use of computer based assessments As discussed earlier student content mastery will be assessment via frequent and ongoing online assessments Programs such as iReady ST Math and Study Island will be utilized at all grade levels to provide teachers and school leaders and parents with frequent measures of student performance As students use these programs their familiarity with the computerbased process will increase and help to ensure their readiness for the computerbased state standardized assessments CORE HealthPhysical Education Extensive research has documented the importance of quality play time for young children and the impact that healthy organized play can in decreasing bullying and help children return to the classroom ready to learn See eg playworksorg whyplaymattersstudies Our standardsbased physical education and health curriculum will cover the following strands movement skills and knowledge selfimage and personal development and social development The physical education program will emphasize individual motor skills fitness and good sportsmanship Human development is also a central part of the health curriculum Physical education aims to develop the students physical competence and knowledge of movement and safety and their ability to use there to perform in a wide range of activities associated with the development of an active and healthy lifestyle Health education aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to maintain healthy lifestyles Community Preparatory Academy implements lessons and activities based on the five National Physical Education Standards as well as the eight National Health Standards and grade level outcomes for all students Community Preparatory Academy utilizes PlayWorks the acclaimed national program that provides supervised play and physical activity for students throughout the school day Playworks coaches supervise organized activities during recess class games and afterschool teaching children basic sports skills and physical fitness but also crucial skills of fair play and positive conflict resolution A study conducted by Mathematica Policy Research and Stanford University found that Playworks schools have less bullying and exclusionary behavior transitions from recess to learning activities are easier students have better behavior and attention in class after participation in sports games and play and teachers at Playworks schools perceive students to be safer during recess and engage in more inclusive play In a nationwide survey of more than principals and teachers in schools that partnered with Playworks respondents reported they reclaimed an average of hours of teaching time because there are fewer behavioral problems on the playground and in the classroom httpwwwplayworksorgabout Playworks coaches are offered free of charge to schools with more than percent FRPL enrollment All students receive minutes of physical education instruction every days meeting or exceeding the minimum requirement stated in g of the Education Code Our program not only focuses on children developing healthy exercise habits and discovering a physical activity that interests them but also helps them develop critical skills and habits in teamwork cooperation and sportsmanship We ensure that our yard supervisors and other staff who supervise children at recess and play time have appropriate training to ensure that students engage in organized cooperative activities that help develop social skills and team work Students also have one class each week in HealthCharacter Education Topics such as nutrition diet healthy choices interpersonal relationships and conflict resolution are introduced and built upon at each grade level all following state content standards Unique Learning Components Community Preparatory Academy instructional philosophy is to use sound researchbased instruction that has proven to be effective with traditionally underserved students The underlying theory of the philosophy is twofold Highly effective teaching instruction based on Charlotte Danielsons Framework for Teaching and Culturally and linguistically responsive teaching and learning Hollie Each of these elements provides a philosophical foundation for the curriculum and instruction at Community Preparatory Academy to be focused around the single most powerful variable related to student achievement quality teaching While the curriculum what we do is important it is the instruction the why and the how that will make the difference for our students All teachers or those connected to the classroom will have a serious buyin and deep understanding of what makes for quality teaching what is culturally and linguistically responsive teaching and what are the learning expectations and benchmarks of the common core standards The following describes the schools unique design that reflects how Community Preparatory Academy believes learning best occurs These elements are consistent with the schools vision mission and target population and will be carefully aligned to the student performance standards and assessments described elsewhere in this Petition Community Preparatory Academys unique school design has three interdependent learning components specifically intended to develop selfmotivated competent lifelong learners who are capable of transferring knowledge and skill and possess the ability to think critically Academic Excellence In addition the schools design components develop character through a global understanding and universal respect for the lifestyles views and beliefs about self and others Personal WellBeing and leaders with the capacity to perceive needs and apply leadership skills effectively Social Responsibility Below is a summary of the three fully integrated and mutually enriching learning components followed by a more detailed description including the type of curriculum and instruction that will be incorporated within each element to ensure that students become lifelearners and develop social and emotional wellbeing Academic Excellence Community Preparatory Academy offers a curriculum based in four major content areas EnglishLanguage Arts Mathematics Science and HistorySocial Science Noncore subject matter includes study of the Humanities Arts and Physical Education A projectbased approach provides opportunities to integrate multiple content areas and for teachers to be responsive to student interests as another means to address instructional standards and achieve learning outcomes All areas of study are developed in alignment with constructivist and projectbased considerations Personal WellBeing Community Preparatory Academy equips students with the principles that embrace a global understanding and universal respect for lifestyles views and beliefs of others Within the emotional well being component students are taught to resolve conflicts peacefully This is accomplished through relationship building and by providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to help them lead caring responsible and productive lives All classrooms facilitate conflict resolution techniques as a means to solve problems that arise with and between students and the staff Social Responsibility By accessing resources in the community Community Preparatory Academy provides opportunities for ongoing civic engagement and leadership This increases the students understanding of ways to contribute to society Students collaborate with parents the community and teachers to create innovative ways to apply their knowledge in a realworld context Students will begin to discover the answer to the persistent question of What is my role in both my immediate and the global community How can I make a contribution How do I impact change Of course curriculum selection is meaningless without effective teachers to implement our program With the goal of a balanced approach to teaching and learning in mind our program is grounded in the following key principles of learning that have emerged from extensive research on effective teaching Effective teachers create ambitious and meaningful tasks that reflect how knowledge is used in the field Effective teachers engage students in active learning so that they apply and test what they know Effective teachers draw connections to students prior knowledge and experiences Effective teachers diagnose student understanding in order to scaffold the learning process step by step Effective teachers assess student learning continuously and adapt teaching to student needs Effective teachers provide clear standards and constant feedback Effective teachers encourage strategic and metacognitive thinking so that students learn to and guide their own learning DarlingHammond The following provides more description of Community Preparatory Academys educational philosophies and instructional methodologies To be clear instruction at Community Preparatory Academy starts first with the Common Core standards and the frameworks for instructional design all of which drive the creation of lesson plans and the assessment of both student and teacher achievement Community Preparatory Academys balanced approach will provide a standardsbased curriculum that is both skillsbased and handson Resnicks Principles of Learning Constructivism ProjectBased LearningPlaceBased Learning and Field Work Balanced Instruction Family Involvement Resnicks Principles of Learning Dr Lauren Resnicks Nine Principles of Learning based on decades of learning research and widely implemented in highly effective schools are designed to foster learning oriented goals in ways that promote effort Community Preparatory Academy will take these nine principles to heart Organizing for Effort An effortbased school replaces the assumption that aptitude determines what and how much students learn with the assumption that sustained and directed effort can yield high achievement for all students Everything is organized to evoke and support this effort to send the message that effort is expected and that tough problems yield to sustained work All students are taught a rigorous curriculum matched to the standards along with as much time and expert instruction as they need to meet or exceed expectations Clear Expectations If we expect all students to achieve at high levels then we need to define explicitly what we expect students to learn These expectations need to be communicated clearly in ways that get them into the heads of school professionals parents and the community and above all students themselves Fair and Credible Evaluations If we expect students to put forth sustained effort over time we need to use assessments that students find fair and that parents community and employers find credible and provide credible evaluations of what individual students know and can do Recognition of Accomplishment If we expect students to put forth and sustain high levels of effort we need to motivate them by regularly recognizing their accomplishments Clear recognition of authentic accomplishment is a hallmark of an effortbased school Recognition of accomplishment can be tied to opportunity to participate in events that matter to students and their families Academic Rigor in a Thinking Curriculum Thinking and problem solving will be the new basics of the st century But the common idea that we can teach thinking without a solid foundation of knowledge must be abandoned So must the idea that we can teach knowledge without engaging students in thinking Knowledge and thinking are intimately joined This implies a curriculum organized around major concepts that students are expected to know deeply Teaching must engage students in active reasoning about these concepts In every subject at every grade level instruction and learning must include commitment to a knowledge core high thinking demand and active use of knowledge Accountable Talk Talking with others about ideas and work is fundamental to learning But not all talk sustains learning Accountable Talk seriously responds to and further develops what others in the group have said It puts forth and demands knowledge that is accurate and relevant to the issue under discussion Accountable Talk uses evidence appropriate to the discipline eg proofs in mathematics data from investigations in science textual details in literature documentary sources in history and follows established norms of good reasoning Socializing Intelligence Intelligence is much more than an innate ability to think quickly and stockpile bits of knowledge Intelligence is a set of problemsolving and reasoning capabilities along with the habits of mind that lead one to use those capabilities regularly Intelligent habits of mind are learned through the daily expectations placed on the learner By calling on students to use the skills of intelligent thinkingand by holding them responsible for doing so educators can teach intelligence This is what teachers normally do with students they expect much from it should be standard practice with all students Selfmanagement of Learning If students are going to be responsible for the quality of their thinking and learning they need to developand regularly usean array of selfmonitoring and selfmanagement strategies These metacognitive skills include noticing when one doesnt understand something and taking steps to remedy the situation as well as formulating questions and inquiries that let one explore deep levels of meaning Students also manage their own learning by evaluating the feedback they get from others bringing their background knowledge to bear on new learning anticipating learning difficulties and apportioning their time accordingly and judging their progress toward a learning goal These are strategies that good learners use spontaneously and all students can learn through appropriate instruction and socialization Learning environments should be designed to model and encourage the regular use of selfmanagement strategies Learning as Apprenticeship For many centuries most people learned by working alongside an expert who modeled skilled practice and guided novices This kind of apprenticeship allowed learners to acquire complex interdisciplinary knowledge practical abilities and appropriate forms of social behavior Much of the power of apprenticeship learning can be brought into schooling by organizing learning environments so that complex thinking is modeled and analyzed and by providing mentoring and coaching as students undertake extended projects and develop presentations of finished work both in and beyond the classroom Source University of Pittsburg Institute for Learning ifllrdcpitteduiflindexphpresourcesprinciples_of_learning While some of these principles seem straightforward and commonsensical our school leaders will ensure that our faculty students and all members of our school continuously adhere to these core principles of expectation hard work and accountability to help students develop habits of mind and selfdiscipline to be effective engaged learners Constructivism Constructivism provides the guiding principles for lessons whether they are in the format of direct instruction or problembased learning Constructivism calls for the learning experience to be differentiated beginning with each learners level of understanding and guiding students in building upon prior knowledge in a handson way In simplest terms differentiated instruction involves creating multiple paths to learning for diverse learners Tomlinson This differentiated studentcentered approach to instruction enables teachers to focus on the specific needs skills challenges and learning styles of each individual student to ensure that each and every student meets our high expectations for standards mastery To be clear constructivism at Community Preparatory Academy will not mean an abandonment of traditional teaching and direct instruction but rather differentiating learning to meet student needs means that students will have plentiful opportunities to engage in active personalized learning in order to achieve skills mastery rather than offering a one size fits all approach Numerous independent researchers have documented the success of the constructivist model of education with historically underserved populations demonstrating increased test scores and perhaps more importantly improved selfconfidence and whole development Amaral Mester Hollins King J and Hayman Mathison Young Thornton McEntee McCombs ONeil Drillings Freire Research also shows that students who attend schools that employ constructivist methodologies gain critical thinking skills deeper understandings and learning that lasts Marlowe and Page Students in a constructivist model are given the means to explore solve problems reflect on situations and demonstrate their knowledge individually and in groups allowing learners to construct their own meaning Through group learning students have the opportunity to interact with and learn from other students on more complex tasks than they could engage in alone provides immediate feedback encourages them to explore their own and other students ideas and helps develop communication and interpersonal skills Teachers also scaffold the learning of students and differentiate instruction by breaking down tasks using modeling prompting and coaching to teach strategies for thinking and problem solving to help students become proficient at conducting the relevant inquiry activities Blumenfeld et al leading ultimately to mastery of the desired state standards In these ways each students existing beliefs theories and perceptions are challenged through conversation handson activities or experiences Learners work actively with concrete materials try out ideas solve problems make mistakes and correct them and have opportunities to stop and reflect on what they have done The more actively engaged children are in the learning process the more effectively they will understand and retain concepts and skills that are delineated in the state standards Carol Tomlinson notes that culture plays an important role in how students learn Identical learning environments and procedures do not work for all students Tomlinson further asserts that student motivation increases when they can build on topics of interest as modifying instruction to draw on student interests is likely to result in greater student engagement higher levels of intrinsic motivation higher student productivity greater student autonomy increased achievement and an improved sense of selfcompetence this cultural context Tomlinson At Community Preparatory Academy will integrated throughout learning as students teachers and community members with varying backgrounds and experiences come together to learn from one another as well as with one another At Community Preparatory Academy we embrace the notion that what works for one student and what holds meaning and resonance for one will not work for all thus teachers will be supported in continuously adapting learning to serve student needs rather than expecting students to adapt to the curriculum One form of constructivist learning PlaceBased Education will also be a powerful tool for exploration at Community Preparatory Academy as students get out of the classroom and explore their community and the myriad resources it has to offer through regular Field Studies Through partnerships with local civic organizations business and community leaders arts organizations and more we plan to ensure that our students walk through and explore their neighborhood on a regular basis learning about its history its people its culture and its resources As a school located in the heart of Los Angeles a fastpaced urban environment that is unique we want to break down the walls of school and engage our students in learning beyond the confines of books and desks and to truly get out into the real world Through these experiences students will understand connections between their learning in social science science math and English language arts as well as the arts and physical activities all connecting to their neighborhood We aim to instill in our students a sense of civic pride and responsibility and understanding of the ways in which people and resources in our urban community interact and impact one another The following principles highlight the components and values of placebased learning each directly embraced by Community Preparatory Academy for the success of our students Learning takes place onsite in the schoolyard the local community and environment Learning focuses on local themes systems and content Learning is personally relevant to the learner Learning experiences contribute to the communitys vitality and environmental quality and support its role in fostering global environmental quality Learning is supported by strong and varied partnerships with local organizations agencies businesses and government Learning is interdisciplinary Learning experiences are tailored to the local audience Learning is grounded in and supports the development of a love for ones place Local learning serves as the foundation for understanding and participating appropriately in regional and global issues Placebased education programs are integral to achieving other institutional goals Source wwwpromiseofplaceorg The level of activity and excitement simple walking explorations have on childrens enthusiasm for learning is profound As students develop awareness of their own neighborhood and the people and places within it they will learn to care for their community and become engaged in the neighborhoods success ProjectBased Learning At their best projects can serve a number of purposes well They engage students over a significant period of time spurring them to produce drafts revise their work and reflect on it They foster positive cooperativeness in which each student can make a distinctive contribution They model the kind of useful work that is carried out after the completion of school in the wider community They allow students to discover their areas of strength and to put the best foot forward they engender a feeling of deep involvement or flow substituting intrinsic for extrinsic motivation Cskszentmihlyi Through projectbased learning our students will engage in complex and challenging tasks and problem solving both independently and in small groups engaging in a depth of learning that creates true understanding beyond rote memorization of facts This does not mean that Community Preparatory Academy students will miss out on direct instruction that targets specific skills or concepts On the contrary explicit instruction particularly in reading writing and mathematics will play an important role within the overall delivery of instruction Skillspecific academic needs will be identified through formative and summative assessments and subsequently addressed through direct instruction Phonics reading fluency reading comprehension sentence structure grammar and arithmetic are examples of skill areas that will be introduced and reinforced explicitly by teachers working with students individually in small groups and as a whole class Through projects however our faculty is able to accomplish a number of objectives in an engaging relevant way for students of all ages and enable students to Acquire communicate and investigate worthwhile knowledge in depth Instead of dividing instruction into disconnected learning blocks students will be able to view school subjects as connected and interrelated much like real life As students explore topics in a variety of ways and through various sources they will learn to relate what they are learning to their own lives When students view their learning as having personal relevance they put more effort into their schoolwork and achievement Willis Cskszentmihlyi Activities will be assigned for home exploration that will help students bridge school learning and their lives at home with the intent of helping students develop problemsolving and decisionmaking skills Integrate reading writing listening speaking and thinking across the curriculum As noted by the California Science Standards Framework Effective science programs use standardsbased connections with other core subjects to reinforce science teaching and learning Reading writing mathematics and speaking skills are all needed to learn and do science In self contained classrooms teachers incorporate science content in reading writing and mathematics CA Science Framework p Narrative and expository literature and high interest trade books will serve as key resources for thematic instruction Extensive research documents the power of reading and writing across the curriculum to create active readers and writers by engaging students in authentic literacy tasks that emerge naturally from interesting and worthwhile topics and ideas Vogt see also Heibert Fielding and Pearson Make choices interact collaborate and cooperate Students will explore topics individually in small groups and together as a whole class Reading and writing tasks will be authentic motivating relevant and contextualized Students will make appropriate choices based on their interests abilities and needs Participate and learn regardless of ability level of language development or background One of the most important advantages of crosscurricular thematic instruction is that it is flexible and adaptable Thematic learning allows teachers to implement a variety of instructional approaches that best meet the students needs For example while some students may need extra practice with a strategy or skill others may need additional time for writing or independent reading This flexibility is central to thematic teaching Projectbased learning has significant benefits for English learners as well Karen Carrier in Key Issues for Teaching English Language Learners in Academic Classrooms Middle School Journal November identifies three key challenges English Learners face in the academic classroom The amount of time required for second language acquisition The dual job of ELs learning content and learning the language The need for multiple modes of input and output At Community Preparatory Academy specific time is devoted to projects in our bell schedule during the ScienceSocial Science extended block three times weekly for Kindergarteners and five days a week for all other students While the projects will stem from themes in science and social science literacy skills writing math and the arts will all be integrated Teachers in the projectbased learning block will be able to frontload key vocabulary and concepts and engage in multiple modes of instruction within one class period therefore meeting the needs of diverse learners Projectbased learning also naturally allows for multiple modes of input and output providing students with realworld applications and built in visuals and realia to contextualize new learning There are a wealth of resources available to our faculty online to help them develop ideas and lesson plans for projectbased work including the acclaimed Buck Institute for Education bieorg Edutopia pblonlineorg and dozens of others In addition we hope to partner with established schools in Los Angeles that already have been implementing successful projects to learn from their experience Schools such as Open Charter Magnet School with a highly acclaimed and recognized model of project based instruction offer attend popular institute training teacher faculty that will our Balanced Instruction At Community Preparatory Academy success will not be defined simply based on academic prowess in the four core subject areas but rather far more broadly in ensuring each and every student demonstrates a wide array of skills and talents that go well beyond literacy math science and social science a whole child approach Drawing from acclaimed theories of human development such as Howard Gardners Multiple Intelligence Theory Community Preparatory Academy will ensure that students have ample opportunity to develop all areas of their talents and interests beyond the four core academic subjects As Gardner has explained rather than measuring intelligence as one finite figure or concept human cognitive competence is better described in terms of a set of abilities talents or mental skills intelligences All normal individuals possess each of these skills to some extent individuals differ in the degree of skill and in the nature of their combination [I]ntelligences always work in concert and any sophisticated adult role will involve a melding of several of them Gardner Multiple Intelligences New Horizons Specifically Gardner has identified eight broad areas of intelligence some of which align clearly with the four core academic subject areas while others cross subjects and realms Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language including the ability to use language to accomplish certain goals to listen perceptively and read critically to learn languages to express oneself persuasively or poetically Logicalmathematical intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking the ability to detect patterns reason deductively and think logically conceptually and abstractly the interest in experimentation puzzles investigations and cosmic questions Musical intelligence involves the capacity to distinguish the whole realm of sound and in particular to discern appreciate and apply the various aspects of music pitch rhythm tambor mood both separately and holistically Bodilykinesthetic intelligence involves the ability to use ones body in highly differentiated and skilled ways for both goaloriented and expressive purposes the capacity to exercise fine and gross motor control of ones body Spatial intelligence involves the ability to accurately perceive the visual world and to re create manipulate and modify aspects of ones perceptions even in the absence of the relevant visual stimuli Interpersonal intelligence relates to the ability to work cooperatively and communicate verbally and nonverbally with other people the insight to understand others intentions motivations and desires and the judgment to recognize the biases underlying sources of information Intrapersonal intelligence involves the ability to understand oneself the motivation and focus to study independently and the wisdom to reflect The first and most important ability you can develop in a flat world is the ability to learn how to learn to constantly absorb and teach yourself Friedman Naturalist intelligence added to Gardners theory in involves the ability to recognize collect analyze and classify plants minerals animals flora fauna and even cultural objects such as cars and sneakers Those who excel in naturalist intelligence exhibit a greater sensitivity to nature and their place within it the ability to nurture and grow things and care for animals

Students with Special Needs No child will be excluded from the admissions process or excluded from attending Community Preparatory Academy due to hisher English language fluency academic achievement IEP or suspected disability or any other factor Community Preparatory Academy is committed to serving all students who wish to attend our school and will not discourage parents of students with special needs from applying for admission or enrolling their child Initial Assessment An entrance assessment including a schooldesigned test derived from state standards and an English language assessment where applicable will be administered to all new students and a baseline assessment will be administered to returning students Throughout the year teachers also will assess students through informal measures such as checklists class work and observations and through more formal means such as Smarter BalancedCalifornia Assessment of Student Performance and Progress CAASPP testing and benchmark assessments both in writing and via online assessment Every other month benchmark assessments will be reviewed in detail during pupilfree days Grade level teams will ensure that modifications such as differentiated instruction scaffolding and alternative assignments will be used to address the needs of individual students Throughout each school day our model of instruction allows for time for small group and individual instruction by teachers and in the lower grades instructional aides In addition students who are struggling will be referred to our afterschool tutoring program for additional instructional assistance These interventions will be recorded in a log or online database which will document the length of time and effectiveness of the modification HomeSchool Communication Teachers will communicate throughout the school year with parents and guardians during formal and informal conferences regarding the social and academic progress of students The Principal will assist both parents and teachers in fostering open communication If a teacher has an urgent or persistent concern the parent or guardian will be contacted and invited to the school to discuss the issue Teachers will receive training and be expected to maintain an open line of communication between the school and the home and will make every effort to ensure that parents and guardians feel welcome at the school and comfortable enough to express their own questions and concerns In addition pending sufficient funding we plan to offer a sophisticated online student information system such as Illuminate that allows parentsguardians to access their childs online profile including data such as attendance and meal participation as well as realtime reporting about online assessments the child has completed homework assignments and other important information Parents will be offered training on using computers and this system and computers will be available at the school for parent use Ultimately we hope to secure grants to fund computers for family use at home In these ways we will further strengthen the partnership between school and home Student Success Team SST Despite the many strengths of the schools programs methods and organizational design additional support may be necessary in instances when students are not making satisfactory academic progress or when their behaviors are impeding their own progress or the progress of others On those occasions a referral to the Student Success Team SST will open a new pathway of support to students Upon enrollment at the school parents will receive information about what to do when they know or suspect their child may need additional supports or when parents are puzzled about their childs development The purpose of the SST is to ensure that the school and community are doing everything possible to make students successful at school The SST mobilizes and coordinates the schools resources and a request for assistance from the SST can be made by a teacher administrator parent or guardian The SST process will be coordinated by the Principal and later by the Assistant Principal who will organize the SST process by managing the including necessary paperwork parentsguardians to SST meetings All teachers will receive professional development regarding identification of student needs modifications and interventions and the SST process The SST process is not being used here to assess for special education services but rather to arrive at strategies and recommendation to ensure support in the general education classroom scheduling meetings and inviting members When a student has been referred to the SST the Team will initiate a meeting that includes the students parentsguardians the Assistant Principal and the students teacher to discuss the concerns in an organized systematic problemsolving manner and develop specific action steps to address them The SST process begins by reviewing the students work portfolio and clarifying the students strengths and other known background information and continues with a discussion of the concerns and the supports andor interventions that have been tried The meeting concludes after an action plan has been prepared and agreed upon which includes modifications and supports to be provided by the teacher as well as other intervention strategies for the family to implement at home and outside of school along with a timeline for successful intervention Following is an outline of the SST process Prior to the SST Meeting Teacher parent or other staff member completes a referral form The Principal receives the referral and determines at the weekly meeting which individuals need to be present at the SST Meeting regarding the student including the childs teacher and parentsguardians and completes a preparation checklist for the SST meeting The Principal schedules the SST Meeting with all identified parties during the SST Meeting All necessary team members are present including parents or guardians A translator is provided if needed or requested by the parent The SST facilitator introduces all members of the team The purpose of the meeting is clearly stated A timekeeper is appointed Team members including the parents or guardians share their knowledge of the student beginning with the students strengths and other known background Information and referring to the students ILP and additional information Members have access to student achievement data and work samples at the meeting Concerns are presented and synthesized to focus on the primary issues The team brainstorms a broad range of strategies for intervention or modifications to address the identified concerns The team selects the best strategies and an action plan for next steps is developed collaboratively Responsibilities and timelines are assigned A follow up meeting is scheduled to discuss progress and outcomes Post SST Meeting Meeting notes are copied and distributed to team members Action items are monitored for follow through SST members and parents or guardians are reminded of scheduled follow up meetings Following the implementation of an SST plan and follow up if concerns continue a second meeting may be set where revisions to the original SST plan are discussed ENGLISH LEARNERS Community Preparatory Academy serves a growing number of English Learners To address the needs of EL students all of the major components of Community Preparatory Academys instructional program have been carefully designed to promote the academic and social success of EL students Several key features of effective programs for English Learners were identified during a study of exemplary schools that successfully provide academic programs to English Learners in California wwwsharingsuccessorg Many of those features have been incorporated within the program at Community Preparatory Academy such as Inclusion The program for English Learners is an integral part of the school neither conceptually nor physically separated from the rest of the school Enrichment English Learners are provided with a rich intellectual program not a remedial curriculum The instructional approach for all students emphasizes critical thinking hands on learning relevance and connection across the disciplines Coordination A premium is placed on coordination and collaboration both horizontally and vertically across grade levels Weekly schedules have been designed to provide common planning time for teachers Internal Impetus Community Preparatory Academy teachers and school leaders are the driving force and key players in designing and implementing innovative curricular and instructional approaches Identification of English Learners Community Preparatory Academy adheres to all applicable state and federal laws and regulations with respect to serving students who are English Learners In order to identify students who are English Learners in a timely fashion and to provide appropriate instructional support and services all parents are required to complete a Home Language Survey upon enrollment at the school Cal Education Code Students whose primary language is not English will be assessed using the California English Language Development Test CELDT if he or she has not previously been identified as an English Learner by a California public school or if there is no record of prior CELDT test results CELDT testing takes place within days of the start of the school year or within two weeks after the date of first enrollment at the school The English language proficiency of all currently enrolled English Learners is assessed in accordance with the test contractors directions and California Education Code guidelines Students with disabilities are permitted to take the test with the accommodations listed in the Education Code if they are specified in the students IEP or Section plan An alternate assessment for English language proficiency is administered to students who are unable to participate in the CELDT test according to the guidelines set forth in the students IEP Community Preparatory Academy staff will notify parents of the schools responsibility to conduct CELDT testing and will inform parents of CELDT testing results within calendar days following receipt of test results from the test contractor Students are monitored in conjunction with the California English Language Development Standards levels described below ELD Beginning The student will respond in English using gestures simple words and phrases to demonstrate understanding while working with familiar situations and texts ELD Early Intermediate The student will respond in English using expanded vocabulary in phrases and simple sentences to demonstrate understanding of story details and basic situations with increasing independence ELD Intermediate The student will respond in English using expanded vocabulary and descriptive words for social and academic purposes with increased complexity and independence but with some inconsistencies ELD Early Advanced The student will respond in English using complex vocabulary with greater accuracy the student will also demonstrate detailed understanding of social and academic language and concepts with increased independence ELD Advanced The student is required to respond in English using extended vocabulary in social and academic discourse to negotiate meaning and apply knowledge across the content areas Community Preparatory Academy will maintain a record of all students who participate in each administration of the CELDT test as specified in Education Code CELDT testing will be used to fulfill the requirements for annual English proficiency testing and will comply with the accountability requirements under Title III of the No Child Left Behind Act CPA will adhere to all legal requirements regarding oversight and administration of the CELDT test Reclassification of English Learners Before the issuance of each progress report card teachers will summarize students mastery of standards for their current ELD level by looking at assessment material collected throughout the quarter EL students will receive ELD grades in addition to ELA grades in reading writing listening and speaking At the end of the semester teachers will also go through the list of standards for a students current ELD level and determine if the student has mastered every standard for his or her current level and is ready to move to the next ELD level Teachers will present evidence eg scored writing samples rubrics from oral presentations to the Assistant Principal who will work with teachers to make the final decision regarding progression to the next ELD level Reclassification criteria and procedures are outlined below Reclassification Criteria CELDT Overall performance level of or and skill area scores of or higher in listening speaking reading and writing Standards Based Report Card Meets or exceeds expectations in all ELA Reading Writing and ListeningSpeaking strands as evidenced by a grade of or in a grading system or a grade of C or above in a letter grade system TeacherEL Coordinator EL CoordinatorPrincipal judge that the student will be successful in a mainstream English program This judgment may be based on teacher observation review of student work samples analysis of past standards based report cards judgment Classroom teacher and Parent Opinion and Consultation Notice will be provided to parentsguardians of their rights and they will be encouraged to participate in the reclassification process Teachers will provide an opportunity for a facetoface meeting with the parentsguardians to discuss their childs progress toward English language proficiency Comparison of Basic Skills Performance in basic skills means the score andor performance level resulting from a recent administration of an objective assessment of basic skills in English based on assessments to be determined pending guidance from the State of California Range of performance in basic skills means a range of scores on the assessment of basic skills in English that corresponds to a performance level or a range within a performance level Students of the same age refers to students who are enrolled in the same grade as the student who is being considered for reclassification Reclassification Procedures The following reclassification procedures will be used Each semester the Principal creates a list of all students who meet the CELDT criteria for reclassification as well as an updated potential reclassification list to teachers This document lists by class all students who meet the CELDT criteria for reclassification Each teacher is responsible for completing the report card grade and teacher judgment columns of the reclassification list for their students In some cases the Principal works with the teacher to determine the ability of individual students to master grade level standards without language support Based on the information provided by teachers the Principal identifies students ready to be reclassified and submits these names to the Office Manager The Office Manager sends a reclassification letter to these students parents and submits their names and report cards to the school district Reclassified students continue to be monitored to ensure their continued ability to achieve mastery of state ELA standards Professional development will be focused on enhancing teachers knowledge of how to teach English Learners to read and write as well as how to address the achievement gap by providing pedagogical tools to ensure that all students can meet standards Teachers authorized to teach English Learners will continue to receive training and support in the effective implementation of techniques such as Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English and Scaffolding Teachers will also observe model lessons and receive feedback on their implementation of new techniques English Learners will continue to be reevaluated annually using the CELDT test until such time as they have demonstrated that they are able to compete effectively with Englishspeaking peers in mainstream classrooms and are reclassified as fluent English proficient RFEP CPA will set a demanding reclassification target annually The reclassification process will utilize multiple criteria based on the guidelines approved by the State Board of Education and will include the following Assessment of language proficiency Teacher evaluation Parent opinion in consultation with the school Community Preparatory Academy has set a demanding reclassification target for annual student progress Students at CPA will be expected to progress English language levels each year through targeted instruction and assessment It is anticipated that students who are enrolled at CPA beginning in kindergarten will be redesignated as fluent English proficient RFEP prior to middle school Students who enroll at the school in subsequent years whose language development is still in the beginning or early intermediate stage will be receive added intervention from the teacher through small group instruction targeted to meet their individual needs with a goal that they will stay on target to advance levels or more per year such that they can be reclassified during their K career The Principal is to serve as the testing coordinator and will meet periodically with teachers throughout the school year during grade level planning to discuss the progress of English Learners toward mastery of the ELD standards The testing coordinator will continue to monitor students who are redesignated as RFEP during a period of two years to ensure that they are able to keep up with their peers CELDT testing will not be required during the monitoring period Support for English Learners in Reading The instructional program for English Learners at Community Preparatory Academy will be planned according to students assessed level of literacy reading and writing in both English and their primary language and according to their proficiency listening speaking reading and writing in English Students will begin English language arts instruction with literacy instruction augmented by concurrent daily formal linguistic instruction in English Language Development ELD As mentioned students who are English Learners also will be served within the classroom through daily English language development ELD lessons on an individual and small group basis During these focused sessions both within the classroom for example during reading instruction time and in pull out sessions as needed where students work with a teacherspecialist while the rest of the class is with another instructor or during assigned afterschool tutoring students will be grouped homogeneously according to their ELD level Teachers will use the Hampton Brown Avenues curriculum as the foundation of the ELD program Key academic vocabulary and concepts will be introduced utilizing the strategies described above and a Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English SDAIE approach To ensure that the teaching faculty is able to work successfully with EL students classroom teachers at Community Preparatory Academy will be required to possess a Crosscultural Language and Academic Development CLAD certificate or equivalent as a condition of employment Support for English Learners who are learning to read in kindergarten and first grade is particularly important Early intervention is the key to proficiency later on To address this critical issue kindergarten teachers will utilize the following strategies in their classrooms Students will have sufficient opportunities through prior activities in phonemic awareness to hear distinguish and produce sounds being introduced Phonological differences between English and the students primary language will be identified and students will be provided additional exposure to and practice with the difficult sounds Students will be provided with additional systematic guidance and practice if they are unable to match all consonant and shortvowel sounds to appropriate letters Teachers will provide brief practice sessions for English learners who are having difficulty in learning lettersound correspondences Students will participate in additional review and practice of particularly difficult letter sounds Teachers will ensure that students have had previous instruction or experiences or both with the words included in the instruction and that they understand their meaning Teachers will encourage English learners to take home ageappropriate materials eg flash cards decodable text handouts related to the teaching objective Instructional Strategies to Support English Learners In addition to the major program design features at Community Preparatory Academy that support students who are English Learners teachers at CPA will employ the following specific strategies in their classrooms notably these strategies are beneficial for all students not just English Learners Six Key Strategies for Teachers of English Learners Vocabulary and Language Development i Teachers will introduce new concepts by discussing vocabulary words key to that concept ii Teachers will build on students background knowledge iiiClassrooms will reflect a language rich environment ie language charts shared reading and writing experiences other writing displayed throughout the room and used daily by students Adapted from Alliance for Excellent Education December Case study on the New Teacher Center University of California at Santa Cruz and Project GLAD Guided Language Acquisition Design Guided Interaction collaborative learning iTeachers will structure lessons so students work together to understand what they read by listening speaking reading and writing collaboratively about the academic concepts in the text iiTeachers will provide students with opportunities to negotiate meaning from language and text and to work in cooperative pairs or groups to develop problem solving and social skills iiiTeachers will group students flexibly at times working in heterogeneous groups and at times not Metacognition and Authentic Assessment i Rather than having students simply memorize information teachers will model and explicitly teach thinking skills metacognition crucial to learning new concepts ii Teachers will use a variety of activities to check for student understanding acknowledging that students learning a second language need a variety of ways to demonstrate their understanding of concepts that are not wholly reliant on advanced language skills iii Teachers will make thinking public the metacognitive aspect of teachers and students modeling how an answer was arrived at not merely what the correct answer was Explicit Instruction i Teachers will utilize direct teaching methods to teach concepts academic language reading comprehension strategies text patterns vocabulary writing patterns and decoding skills needed to complete classroom tasks MeaningBased Context and Universal Themes iTeachers will incorporate meaningful references from the students everyday lives and use them as springboards to interest them in academic concepts iiTeachers will create classroom environments that provide authentic opportunities for use of academic language iiiTeachers will provide students with opportunities to activate and focus prior knowledge via inquiry charts brainstorming and clustering Modeling Graphic Organizers and Visuals i Teachers will regularly utilize a variety of visual aids graphic organizers such as Thinking Maps pictures diagrams summaries and charts to help English learners easily recognize essential information and its relationship to supporting ideas Sheltered Instruction Specially Designed Academic Instruction in English SDAIE Similar to differentiated instruction and universal design sheltered instruction is also grounded in a pedagogical commitment to meeting the needs of diverse learners in this case particularly those students who are English Learners The teachers at Community Preparatory Academy will engage in the following practices to support universal access of subject matter content for all students During lesson planning and preparation teachers will identify lesson objectives aligned with state and local standards Teachers will link new content to students background experiences and introduce unfamiliar vocabulary to facilitate comprehension Teachers will use controlled vocabulary sentence structure visuals and gestures as necessary and appropriate to make the presentation of content comprehensible Teachers will provide students with a variety of strategies for organizing and retaining information associated with effective learning such as graphic organizers and note taking Teachers will provide students with regular opportunities to interact with their peers through collaborative learning activities such as thinkpairshare partner and group projects Teachers will provide students with regular opportunities to use new language skills in context Teachers will pace lessons appropriately to allow for the participation and active engagement of all students Teachers will utilize languagebased as well as contentbased assessments As such teachers will implement Strategically Designed Academic Instruction in English strategies in classrooms throughout the school Community Preparatory Academy teachers will have or receive professional development during the Summer Teachers Institute as well as followup sessions at least once every other month with additional opportunities for those who are interestedidentified by school leaders as needing additional training regarding the following strategies for working effectively with students who are English learners Based on the eight broad elements of sheltered instruction described by Echevarria Vogt and Short Making content comprehensible for English learners The SIOP model Boston Allyn and Bacon Modified speech slower speech rate clear enunciation controlled vocabulary use of cognates limited use of idiomatic speech words with double meaning defined Contextual clues gestures and facial expressions meaning acted out colorcoded materials graphic organizers Multisensory experiences realia props and manipulatives audiovisual materials hands on activities and demonstrations overhead transparencies and similar projection technologies Comprehensible input graphic organizers maps charts graphs word banks with picture clue bulletin boards explanation of word origins etymology use of examples and analogies Frequent comprehension checks questions asked about details eliciting responses through various modalities write on whiteboards thumbs updown etc Formative assessment confirmation checks clarification requests repetitions expansions variety of question types Summative assessment mastery assessed using a variety of modalities review of main topics and key vocabulary resulting product shows mastery of key concepts and synthesis of information Appropriate lesson design student fluency level is reflected evidence of scaffolding listening and speaking activities precede reading and writing activities reading assignments include prereading during reading postreading activities writing activities preceded by prewriting use of cooperative learning groups accessing prior knowledge appropriate pacing modeling of activities specific learning strategies or study skills are taught and modeled text adaptation emphasis on higher order critical thinking skills provision of native language support when possible extensiondebriefing activities included Contentdriven rigorous core curriculum not watered down key topics organized around main themes topics appropriate to grade level SDAIE instruction also focuses on strategies for taking students Into Through and Beyond the topics covered For example SDAIEenhanced instruction for a sixth grade social science unit on Ancient Greece might proceed as follows I Into Determining what the students know about the topic of study Possible SDAIE strategies for Into Anticipatory Guide Students are given a series of statements that relate to concepts they will be studying in their unit on Ancient Greece Students indicate AGREE or DISAGREE After the information has been presented students check to see if they were correct Brainstorming Students work in small groups Each group begins with a stimulus such as a word phrase picture or object related to the topic of Ancient Greece A recorder records all responses to that stimulus and ideas from each group are shared with the class II Through The teacher enhances direct instruction on the topic by utilizing realia manipulatives visuals graphic organizers and various modes of interaction between students In addition to reading the text and listening to information presented by the teacher students takes responsibility for learning by participating in groupwork and sharing understanding with others Possible SDAIE strategies for Through Graphic Organizers Students complete a variety of graphic organizers as they read or listen to information on Ancient Greece Graphic organizers used might include ComparisonContrast Matrix Students determine similarities and differences between Ancient Greece and the Ancient Egyptian culture previously studied Flowcharts Students sequence important events in the development of the Greek culture Cause and Effect Chart Students chart the ways in which geographical features of Ancient Greece shaped Greek culture and economy Reciprocal Teaching Two students work together to read a passage in the social science text Student A reads one paragraph aloud then asks Student B one or two good questions based on the reading Student B answers Students A and B discuss questions and answers and repeat the process Picture This Following the introduction of several key vocabulary terms related to the unit a blank paper is divided into eight sections Students draw pictures or symbols to represent words or major concepts They then exchange papers with a partner and try to correctly label each others drawings Reading Guide Students work in small groups to read a longer section of the social science textbook Students first take turns reading the headings of the reading Then with their group students predict what will be discussed in those sections Students write their answers on a prediction chart In their groups students take turns reading the first page aloud and finish reading the selection in silence They write yes or no on the prediction chart to indicate whether or not their predictions were correct Finally students write one thinking question Why How Compare What if and exchange papers to answer each others questions III Beyond To create further understanding students go beyond rote memorization and demonstrate realworld application of the learned information This process requires higherlevel criticalthinking skills Possible SDAIE strategies for Beyond Roam the Room In groups students write down their individual answers to a higherlevel question posed by the teacher eg if only one idea or invention from the Greek culture could be passed on to subsequent cultures what should it be and why Students share their answers within their group and the group comes up with and records on chart paper one best answer for their group Groups then walk around to view other groups answers Quotes Students identify quotes from a fictional text related to the unit eg The Odyssey that they feel exemplify important aspects of Greek culture They create a chart listing the quote and the element of Greek culture they feel the quote illustrates SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS Our teachers and staff will all receive training on recognizing symptoms and behaviors indicative of a childs need for additional supports including issues relating to hunger extreme poverty and individual families challenges to meet their childs needs Our SST will be responsible for identifying and monitoring students and families who might need additional resources or supports including referrals to community service organizations as detailed above parents will receive information about the SST and servicessupports available and all staff will receive extensive professional development about identifying and referring students to the SST for additional supportintervention Our emphasis on a school community and the responsibility we have to one another within that community will extend to the parents and families of our students as well Progress of students in this subgroup will be monitored through the regular reporting of benchmark progress data from classroom assessments and monthly conversations between teachers and the Principal on the progress of students in the classroom Community Preparatory Academy will offer a whole day program from kindergarten on and parents will be able to dropoff their children starting at am and through an afterschool program until pm both to best serve our students needs and accommodate working families As demonstrated by the success of countless schools in California and beyond serving students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged income is a not a determining factor in a students ability to succeed academically We have not found systematic research that correlates socioeconomic status with school achievement in a way that can lead to a pedagogical generalization If students that are socioeconomically disadvantaged are low achieving or struggle with learning differences or are identified as English Learners CPA will utilize strategies described in other sections of this petition GIFTED AND TALENTED AND HIGHACHIEVING STUDENTS Gifted and talented and highachieving students will be served within the regular classroom program Teachers at Community Preparatory Academy will use multiple strategies to differentiate instruction for diverse learning styles and ability levels within the schools curriculum Our integrated approach to planning and delivering instruction will be an effective approach for all learners including gifted and talented and highachieving students In the case of gifted and talented and highachieving students teachers will provide a variety of options for students to demonstrate their understanding of what they have learned Identification of Gifted and Talented and HighAchieving Students Teachers will use a variety of assessment measures including standardized assessment data and other classroom performance data to identify students who are gifted Students who achieve significantly above grade level andor demonstrate behaviors consistent with gifted ability may be appropriately identified In certain instances services such as psychological testing might be used to test students for gifted ability depending on the availability of such services Parents and guardians will be informed when their child is suspected of being gifted or identified as gifted so that they can seek appropriate challenges and opportunities for their child Strategies to Support Gifted and Talented and HighAchieving Students Students who are high achievers andor identified as gifted and talented benefit from differentiation and instruction that is flexible enough to meet their specific needs According to Carol Ann Tomlinson a recognized expert in the field of education for gifted students a class is not differentiated when all students are doing the same thing and no adjustments are being made to the difficulty levels of the assignments that are given Tomlinson Community Preparatory Academy has adopted many of the strategies recommended by Tomlinson and others for effective teaching in mixedability classrooms such as Providing alternative andor extension activities for students who have already mastered the content being taught Allowing gifted and talented and high achieving students to work at an accelerated pace Providing opportunities for students to work in flexible groups with other intellectual peers Creating graduated task rubrics and product criteria negotiated jointly by the student and teacher Asking openended questions both in the classroom and on homework assignments that stimulate critical thinking Incorporating a variety of the levels of thinking described in Blooms taxonomy including the higher levels of analysis evaluation and synthesis into lesson content and student work products As a result of program differentiation using the strategies just described the unique learning needs of advanced learners will met within the regular classroom program STUDENTS ACHIEVING BELOW GRADE LEVEL Community Preparatory Academy is committed to ensuring that all students achieve at their maximum learning potential including students achieving below grade level expectations The program at CPA has been expertly designed to meet the needs of all types of students by differentiating instruction increasing student engagement and motivation and providing a stimulating and challenging curriculum with multiple entry points for diverse learners and abilities By using Tiered Intervention teachers will be able to identify students not reaching successful levels of competency through core instruction Tier Core Instruction Students will receive high quality evidencebased instructional strategies and curricula which include differentiated instruction and services providing access to the core for all students Strategies might include preteaching reteaching frontloading academic vocabulary extended practice and focused behavioral intervention Also present will be a process for ensuring the integrity of the delivery of core instruction and intervention such as classroom observations covering the presence or absence of effective instructional strategies Tier Strategic or supplemental Instructional and Intervention In addition to the standardsbased curriculum that all students receive in Tier Tier offers supplemental instruction including provision of higher levels of instructional intensity strategic strategies aligned to core curriculum use of auxiliary materials associated with the core program supplemental materials designed to provide targeted strategic intervention instructional practices to ensure that auxiliary and supplemental materials are integrated with the content of core instruction support to the provider of auxiliary and supplemental instruction to ensure integrity in the delivery of that instruction Tier Intensive Instruction and Intervention Tier instruction and intervention includes more explicit instruction specifically targeted to a discreet instructional behavioral or social emotional skill need Intervention can be accelerated or remedial and is delivered in addition to Tier and Tier instruction Effective Tier instruction and intervention will include increased individualization and smaller group size to include use of effective instructional strategies with high intensity duration and frequency use of instructional practices to ensure that intensive supports are integrated with the core content instruction provision of professional development and ongoing support to providers of intensive instruction to ensure integrity in the delivery of that instruction Teachers will receive training on effective intervention strategies targeted towards the areas of greatest need In order to reach the greatest number of our students falling within this category teachers will be trained to utilize the following best practices High Expectations By believing in and identifying each students potential teachers then utilize the students strengths to help himher reach this potential RealityBased Teaching Students need to be provided with real life purposes for their reading writing and problemsolving Realitybased learning approaches help to build a bridge between school and home thereby helping students see relevance to their learning Many atrisk students do not see the relevance in their schooling and therefore lose motivation to succeed and learn The expected diversity of our student body will influence curricular choices and efforts will always be made to ensure we utilize culturally relevant literature realitybased economic scenarios and multiple perspectives Cooperative Learning Students learn well from each other and opportunities should be provided for students to work together in order to plan create and perform projects as well as to discuss and debate issues Cooperative grouping allows students to practice the social aspect of learning and contributes to active participation and team work Each student can utilize hisher strengths in groups and learn from the strength of hisher peers Varied Assessment As all students possess and utilize different strengths for their learning a teacher who allows for a variety of assessments is more apt to find out what students have truly learned not just how they take a test Portfolios oral presentations openbook tests group projects and graphic maps are only some of the many avenues available for teachers to tap into their students knowledge The wider the variety of assessment the teacher uses and the more authentic and ongoing it is the truer the picture the teacher can get of their students understandings Direct Instruction As an instructional strategy direct instruction responds to the students needs by focusing directly on the skills required to be successful in school and ensuring that these skills are learned Better Thinking and Learning Maryland State Department of Education Students can learn high level concepts if they know how to learn how to question how to access prior knowledge and how to integrate new knowledge The elements of Direct Instruction include Clearly communicating goals for students Structuring academic tasks for students Demonstrating the steps necessary to accomplish a particular academic task Monitoring student progress Providing student practice including through online exercise and feedback to ensure success Holding students accountable for their work through frequent teacher review By continuing to look to research and giving teachers time to meet discuss and learn what works best with their students teachers will continually assure that they are using the most effective strategies for helping all of their students become active and motivated learners who master the knowledge necessary for lifelong learning and success Identification of Students who are AtRisk andor Achieving Below Grade Level It is anticipated that the academic needs of most students will be met through the core elements of the Community Preparatory Academy program Nevertheless in some instances students who are achieving below grade level may require additional assistance to catch up to their peers Students will be identified as under achieving or atrisk of low achievement if Their classroom performance is considered to be one or more years below grade level based on class assignments andor assessments They receive low scores on the new state assessments They fail to demonstrate a minimum of one year of academic growth in reading writing andor mathematics during each year They have an existing IEP Strategies to Support Academically Low Achieving Students Community Preparatory Academy program features have been proven through research and practice in similar school populations to be especially effective with Title I students and students performing below grade level or at significant risk of low achievement The following CPA program elements described throughout this petition are designed to support all students These elements have demonstrated particularly successful results with low achieving students and others who are at risk of school failure and for whom traditional strategies are less likely to be effective An integrated curriculum with projectbased learning Experiential learning A balanced approach to teaching and learning emphasizing inquiry as well as skill development instructional strategies that support diverse learning styles and abilities such as differentiated instruction and Universal Design for Learning A program built on rigorous content standards Opportunitytolearn standards that ensure quality and access for all Highly qualified teachers Smaller class sizes Culture of excellence and high expectations A supportive school community A strong hometoschool connection In the event that students are identified as under achieving they will receive targeted support and assistance above and beyond the regular school program Targeted support for under achieving andor students at risk may include Early intervention from the classroom teacher in reading during readingwriting and literacy blocks in the daily schedule including one on one and small group lessons with direct instruction and scaffoldingsupports detailed throughout this section see above Before or After school tutoring with classroom teachers or other professionals Focused attention prepared in consultation with the student and the parentguardian if needed in the context of the Student Success Team process regarding specific strategies and supports Individual contract with the student detailing clear and achievable responsibilities and benchmarks for the student to achieve Other program modifications and supports as determined by the classroom teacher Classroom Differentiation For Low Achieving Students In addition to the instructional methods and strategies detailed above when appropriate classroom modifications will be made to support low achieving students The following modifications or accommodations may be used by the classroom teachers in coordination with the Student Success Team for students who are low achievers depending on the students specific need Materials Use highlighted or underlined reading materials Provide visual aids Provide concrete manipulative materials Provide taped texts andor other class materials Allow use of calculator Provide materials with wide spacing few items per page and clear print Type teacher materials Methods Provide visual clues andor demonstration model when instructing Read written material to student Provide organizational aids such as outlines etc Utilize peer tutors etc Utilize shared and guided notetaking Use clear and concise directions Provide written steps for directions Have student repeat directions to teacher or peer Use manipulatives Emphasize critical information Preteach vocabulary Preview lesson for student before giving to whole class Reduce languagereading level of assignment Assignments Give directions in small distinct steps writtenpictureverbal Use written backup for oral directions Lower difficulty level Shorten assignment Reduce paper and pencil tasks Read or tape record directions to student Use pictorial directions Give extra cues or prompts Allow student to record or type assignment Adapt worksheets packets Utilize compensatory procedures by providing alternate assignmentstrategy Avoid penalizing for penmanship Pacing Reduce paper and pencil tasks Provide distributed review and drill Extend time requirements Vary activity often Allow breaks Omit assignments requiring copying in timed situation Provide home set of textmaterials for previewreview Testing Give tests orally may include dictated or taped answers Allow student to take test while standing at the board if appropriate Read test to student Preview language of test questions Use visuals or pictures Give similar questions in regular classroom setting before test fillin blank limit items per matching section Use essay tests allow to be dictated Shorten length of test Have test administered to the student outside of the class setting Environment Preferential seating Alter physical room arrangement Define areas concretely Provide for a quiet space Eliminate too many visual distractions Play beat Baroque classical music at a low level when students are doing generative work such as writing reading silently etc Tracking the Academic Progress of Low Achieving Students Community Preparatory Academy will acquire and maintain Illuminate or a similar student achievement data management system that allows the school to effectively track academic progress over time Using the data tracking system the SST which meets weekly teachers and school leaders will monitor the following groups of students by reviewing subgroup data at least monthly and individual student data weekly in order to ensure satisfactory academic progress and to provide timely and targeted intervention when necessary Students identified as achieving below grade level Students identified as being at risk for school failure due to environmental factors Socioeconomically disadvantaged students Title I In the event that struggling students fail to make satisfactory academic progress despite targeted interventions implemented by the classroom teacher the teacher may decide to refer the student to the Student Success Team see above Student Retention If a student is not making adequate progress and becomes a candidate for retention the school will notify the parent in writing and will also contact the childs parent by phone Before March of the current year the childs teacher will consult with the Principal and parent in each case concerning possible retention An interpreter will be provided for parents whose native language is not English In all cases parents will be encouraged to remain involved throughout the process Without parental agreement as part of the decision to retain the success of the retention is questionable After intensive interventions have been implemented and the results documented a collaborative decision to retain may be made As needed the Student Success Team will convene a meeting to determine whether assessment for special education services is needed In the event the student is retained the retention folder will be added to and remain in the childs cumulative folder If the retention is no longer a consideration the retention folder will be stored in the school office throughout the following academic year then discarded If the student moves or transfers to another school the retention folder will accompany the cumulative file STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Teachers at Community Preparatory Academy will implement a wide range of accommodations for students with disabilities All teachers will receive ongoing professional development regarding special education policies strategies for working with students with disabilities and classroom practices that support students with diverse learning styles and abilities Among the topics that will be discussed during professional development sessions will be early identification and strategies that can be used to support struggling learners classroom accommodations for specific observed behaviors and what to do when a teacher or parent suspects a child may be learning disabled OTHER SPECIAL POPULATIONS As noted throughout this charter petition and in particular this section Community Preparatory Academy will utilize a childcentered approach in all aspects of instruction thus we are confident we will meet the needs of every student and help them to succeed All members of our faculty and our instructional leaders will assist each family to ensure the educational success of their child including making appropriate referrals to community organizations A TYPICAL DAY FOR A CPA STUDENT From the moment Jamal and Ysenia the names of two fictitious nd graders at Community Prep Academy leave their homes this morning make the minute walk to school and enter the school gates they are awash in a sense of validation and affirmation that is at the heart of their school experience First and most importantly they feel safe They each amble down the block from their respective homes in their smartly attired school uniforms and bounce across streets eager to start the day They do so without fear as they are well aware of the community development program initiated by their school in conjunction with community leaders including the local city councilman law enforcement clergy and activists that has resulted in safer streets and a peaceful neighborhood Ysenia and Jamal arrive on the school grounds alive with an excitement and anticipation that is palpable an energy that any visitor to the school remarks about immediately upon setting foot on campus They are excited about what surprises Community Circle will bring They say hello to the principal Ysenia getting a hug Jamal getting a pound fist bump who is doing yard supervision this morning and knows each of their names and the names of all the other students who have assembled on the yard as do the other adults doing supervision this morning They see that three upper grade students have convened drums in tow arms and legs akimbo as they stretch and ready themselves to deliver the Drum Call call to order to the school community They like that the school abandoned the traditional school bellbuzzer as the initial signal to come together in the morning and that in its place the upper grade students play a contemporary rhythm on a West African Djembe drum They feel the rhythm and its calling to them that learning has officially begun Ysenia and Jamal can articulate that Community Circle represents an important beginning to their day They know that it is a time meant to affirm their reason for being at school as a community of learners They will share with a visitor to the school this morning that Circle as they call it is the first formal activity of the day designed to touch their hearts elevate their spirits and galvanize the community around a common theme for that daybe it one of the aspirations or habits that make up the character development program and ethics process in use at the school or a relevant and meaningful song reading passage poem speech dance etc Our two superstars begin Community Circle with the Pledge of Allegiance followed by reciting the school motto and ending with a joyous chant of we are CPA empowered to lead Todays Circle activity is a line dance taught to them by one of the school administrators that requires each member of the community to do the dance together in step as One the message to the students being that together as a unified committed community they can accomplish anything they desire Affirmation has been perfect serious in its message but fun in its application And the day has just begun As students enter the classroom the teacher greets each by name shakes their hand says welcome in Espaol and Yoruba Bienvenidos and Ekaabo Students return the welcome phrases to the teacher in like fashion Anticipation then builds once more Its Ysenias turn to lead the Morning Meeting an essential classroom structure that like Community Circle schoolwide sets a tone of readiness reviewing the days learning goals along with news facts and fun tidbits to intrigue Ysenia Jamal and their classmates Ysenia heads to the laptop cart and removes one of the laptops that the school has purchased as part of a ubiquitous computing initiative in which there is technology for every student at the grade level She connects wirelessly to the Internet and using Google Docs opens a Google slide presentation that she has worked on in preparation for the day using the Presentation component of Google Docs webbased software application Ysenia then leads the class through each element of the Morning Meeting The Morning Traffic JamYsenia fires up a popular song that she has received approval from the teacher to play She has listed on the LCD projector that she had connected to her laptop instructions for her classmates that during the two and a half minutes that the song is on to listen to music while they engage in the initial routines of placing their backpack snack or lunch in the designated area in the room submit their homestudy to the homestudy basket and ensure that they have all the needed supplies for the day During this time students are allowed encouraged even to socialize as well thereby benefiting from a learning environment that is culturally responsive to the sociocentric and interpersonal learning styles evident in many of the students in the room Morning Proverb Next she leads the class in proverb study in Espaol El perezoso trabaja doble She reviews the translation The lazy one works twice and asks for interpretations from the class She is delighted when Jamal responds Put forth the effort to do things right the first time or youll have to do them again Whats in a Name Ysenia has researched West African languages and shares a slide in her presentation that lets the class know that the dayname of a male child born on Wednesday is Kwaku and the dayname for a female child born on Wednesday is Akua She then acknowledges and addresses each of her classmates that know that they were born on Wednesday by placing either Kwaku or Akua before their name Fact or Fiction Ysenia asks her classmates to discuss whether the following statement is fact or fiction you are tall in the morning but shorter at night

has been monitored in various ways this schoolyear through various summative and formative formal and informal assessments conducted by individual teachers department and grade level teams and through schoolwide assessments From the widest lens the academic progress of all students is monitored schoolwide initially by diagnostic exams administered in all classes during the first week of instruction in August This establishes a baseline of student readiness in each subject area which is then continually monitored by the publishing of student grades in every subject area in week intervals At the end of every quarter all teachers administer a midterm and final assessment Most data from these summative assessments are collected in both study island and or I ready which allows us to monitor student academic progress vertically from year toyear and laterally across subject areas Additionally literacy levels are annually assessed for English Learners on the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California ELPAC Exam in October All our students from grade students are formally assessed in English and Math proficiency in May on the Smarter Balance Assessment Consortium SBAC exams and performance tasks Attendance and referral data are also collected by office staff teachers and administrators on an online system Powerschool in order to monitor trends that can affect student performance Finally teachers and administrators conduct parent conferences every quarter and continually throughout the school year in order to gather valuable socioemotional information about our students and to understand the greater context of factors that affect their academic performance outside of school On a monthly basis cadre teams meet to review student data and discuss student behavior in order to monitor student academic progress and decline and perhaps identify socioemotional needs that contribute to students performance Finally from the narrowest lens individual teachers continually assess and monitor student progress in each classroom through the use of formative and summative assessments Summative assessments administered in the classroom include tests quizzes final exams midterms projects essays and exit tickets Most of these products are accompanied by rubrics that clearly demonstrate what constitutes advanced proficient basic or below basic performance Formative assessments include classwork homework warmups some exit tickets review assignments and various methods of checkingforunderstanding MEASURABLE PUPIL OUTCOMES Community Preparatory Academy believes that assessment is designed to support and guide instructional practices the learning process and to help students achieve personal mastery It is a tool to recognize accomplishment and certify that knowledge and understanding has been gained Assessment also manifests those areas where understanding is still incomplete and enables teachers students and parents to focus their efforts to where they will produce the greatest benefit Standards not standardization are the basis of assessment Students are acquainted with exemplary work and have an understanding of what their aspirations should be for any given task activity or project The goal is to encourage students to do their personal best and show them their own growth throughout the learning process Community Preparatory Academys assessment methods inform all areas of instruction and are connected with the state standards at each grade level Community Preparatory Academy understands that using assessments effectively and efficiently is crucial to monitoring student progress and overall growth and mastery of content Community Preparatory Academys assessment process insists on collaboration between teacher student and parent The teachers role is to determine a childs individual learning needs based on frequent designated assessments the students role is to document their own learning through a variety of selfevaluation strategies and the parents role is to support their child through the hometoschool connection and develop open communication with their childs teacher and community at large Through this process all stakeholders are responsible for helping students achieve success throughout the school year Community Preparatory Academy recognizes that overall school performance is a reflection of the cumulative success of individual students With consistent progress and improved school performance it is understood that the Charter Schools unique school design continues to significantly improve learning for its students in all areas academically emotionally and socially With ongoing assessment and frequent designated benchmarks teachers will continue to track students learning on formal and informal bases through observational and anecdotal measures to ensure student achievement and proficiency at their respective grade levels Community Preparatory Academy is committed to employing the following methods of assessment Standardized Testing Charter School agrees to comply with and adhere to state requirements for participation and administration of all state mandated tests If Charter School does not test with the District Charter School hereby grants authority to the State of California to provide a copy of all test results directly to the District as well as Charter School Community Preparatory Academys Planned Assessments for all students are Standardized Testing Administered Yearly Academic achievement is measured using the state standardized tests consistent with charter legislation and state guidelines Pre and PostTests Ongoing To more fully and accurately demonstrate learning and growth and acquisition of specific skills Community Preparatory Academy will supplement the standardized tests with other appropriate pre and posttests The pre and posttests assist in measuring individual achievement throughout the school year Individual Learning Plans Ongoing The Individual Learning Plan ILP will further demonstrate and individualize a students progress toward the acquisition of specific core and noncore skills and knowledge English Language Development Folders Ongoing Each ELD student will have a folder containing their CELDT scores English Language Development Standards per their level writing sample to determine their progress and their Moving Into English unit reviews and assessments Yearly teachers will track students ELD progress through their ELD folders Reclassification of English Learner Students should occur on a yearly basis Benchmarks Yearly is a multiage environment specific grade level benchmarks have been created which are tied to the state standards While Community Preparatory Academy Literacy Workshop DailyWeekly Each student has in their ILP folder learning artifacts including but not limited to project work reading assessments word study assessments writing samples etc Mathematicians Workshop DailyWeekly In their ILP folder each student compiles learning artifacts including but not limited to project work numeracy assessments math journal entries observationsanecdotal everyday endofunit assessments context for learning landscapes etc Observation Daily Feedback from the instructional team peers and parentsprimary caregivers are also used Teachers take anecdotal records to document observations made of students work habits and milestones SelfAssessment Selfassessment documents are utilized to help students reflect on their own progress toward achieving their personal and class learning goals CurriculumPublisherprovided Tools Teachers will also use assignments and related assessments eg tests quizzes essays etc to monitor progress Longitudinal survey other data To measure student progress by way of inhouse assessments DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTING Community Preparatory Academy uses and analyzes a variety of data sources to guide instruction for all students In addition to the embedded curriculum assessments we use iReady in ELA and Math to provide us with a baseline at the beginning of the academic year and every weeks students take another diagnostic exam to determine academic progress Students are also given curriculum authored unit exams at the completion of each thematic unit of study We also incorporate project based assessments as another way of monitoring student comprehension and application of standards taught The combined data analysis gives a clear indication of student progress and allows teachers to place students in small groups according to levels to create individualized learning plans and determine and implement intervention andor enrichment Students also monitor their growth through use of data charts in the classrooms Diagnostic data is presented to the Administration and the Board every quarter along with the strategies being implemented for growth Information is also communicated to parents during miniconferences or via the online school platform We examine this data in two ways micro and macro First on a micro level we look at specific questions and examine how students answered questions which give us insight on specific student misunderstandings For example if of the class answered A instead of the correct answer of B we look at the answer A to let us know what the student misconception is After we understand the misconception we build small groups inside the classroom that fix the problem Lastly on a Macro level we look at all the questions in a particular standard and divide the students into mastery groups We reteach core standards that have a miss rate of over We recycle standards with a miss rate of over into small group reteaching and a miss rate of we recycle in homework USE AND REPORTING OF DATA Individual Learning Plans ILPs Community Preparatory Academy proposes to create Individual Learning Plans ILPs for every student as an additional means to assess and monitor student growth and achievement The ILP is a set of individualized core and noncore academic learning goals that guide the students learning towards the schoolwide learning outcomes The parent teacher and student establish the goals based on state teacher and school assessments at the ILP conference each October and monitor student progress throughout the year In the second trimester teachers complete assessments for each student and meet again with the parent and student to ensure progress is being made towards their learning goals Additional interim assessments of student learning are administered throughout the year to monitor student progress towards achieving state and school wide goals these consist of anecdotal and observational records student projects and written work and reflections and formal exams These interim assessments occur at each trimester with parent conferences at each trimester to ensure students are meeting their ILP goals ILP Folder ILP folders are used as warehouses of students scores pre and post testing exams teacher driven assessments and observations student reflections and students work over the course of their learning at Community Preparatory Academy They are thoughtful collections that demonstrate what they are learning what they understand and what progress they are making towards their goals Each student has an ILP Folder including but not limited to learning artifacts such as project work reading assessments word study assessments and writing samples that demonstrate hisher ability to Make meaning of and apply hisher knowledge Use appropriate technology and media to communicate effectively Organize information and manage resources Teachers students and parents review students individual ILP folders to monitor student progress In June parents students and teachers meet for a final time discuss and review students goal At this time preliminary goals will be developed for the upcoming school year The students ILP folder is maintained by the students current teacher and passed on to the ensuing teacher so that every student at the school will have a comprehensive portfolio upon exiting Community Preparatory Academy The data collected in students ILP folders will continue to drive Community Preparatory Academys instructional improvements as staff evaluates individual student growth and achievement Staff will continue to analyze school wide trends ensuring student progress on general outcomes measurements NWEA or equivalent and on standardsbased assessments meeting the individual goals established in their ILPs In core and noncore academic areas the central goal for all students will be for all students to demonstrate academic proficiency in all of the core academic areas Proficiency will be defined as a score of proficient or above on the general outcomes measurements on standardsbased assessments and Satisfactory evaluations on individual student ILP goals projects or presentations Proficiency for students with special needs and students designated as English Language Learners is defined appropriately according to their Individual Learning Plans and English proficiency levels respectively Performance standards and assessments for students with special needs are adapted as appropriate to their Individualized Education Plans as well Additionally performance standards and assessments for English Language Learner students are in accordance with the stateadopted English Language Development standards and CELDT Continuous Improvement In order to best serve students and the community the school will continue to examine and refine its list of student exit outcomes and related methods of assessment over time to reflect the schools vision mission and unique school design and any changes to state or local standards GRADING PROGRESS REPORTING AND PROMOTIONRETENTION Teachers will formally report student progress to parents three times each year using progress reports Teachers will conduct parent conferences twice annually fall and spring at the time progress reports are issued so that parents have regular opportunities to discuss their

use in their classrooms Tier I Infractions Classroom disruptions eg speaking out out of seat Occasional tardiness DisturbingDistressing other students Incomplete workLack of participationPoor teamwork Inappropriate clothing for school Noncompliance with rules Tier I Consequences Use timetothink demerit loss of privileges or points consistently and non emotionally assigned Assign student a written apology Assign contribution plan eg contributing back to the classroom environment Call parents and alert them about behavior eliciting their partnership With the student develop a contract with explicit expectations for behavior and consequences Tier II Strategic or Supplemental Intervention At Tier II teachers will use researchbased instruction intervention strategies and best practices to deliver intervention to students when differentiation of Tier I supports has proven insufficient in improving appropriate social behaviors preventing problem behaviors or reducing them whether inside or outside the classroom environment In Tier II the Charter School will use social skills instruction to increase integration of problem solving conflict resolution and anger management creating opportunities for the student to learn empathy throughout the day Strategies can include debriefing priming and reflection Teachers and support staff will ensure self managementselfmonitoring is

daily report card involving parents and other staff in a partnership of support Tier III Intensive Intervention At Tier III CPA will use the most intensive level of intervention and instruction and will base it on assessed needs Students requiring Tier III supports will continue to receive support and instruction provided at the Tier I and Tier II levels When a students behavior begins to interfere with his or her educational achievement and social interaction with peers and adults a Functional Behavior AssessmentFBA may be developed When developing the FBA a description of the behavior its frequency intensity and duration and the hypothesized function of the behavior will be included as well as data collection and analysis Tier III Infractions which include grounds for

moved the following resolution with the amendment to strike all of the Whereas portion Mr Schmerelson Mr McKenna Mr Melvoin Ms Gonez Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res Whereas In both the primary and general elections of Los Angeles County voters as well as voters in urban counties throughout California overwhelmingly voted for statewide candidates who strongly supported traditional K public education publicly funded early childhood college and careereducation and whose campaigns were funded more through smallerdollar contributions from local individuals than from wealthy outofstate individuals and entities Board of Education Special Meeting Minutes am Whereas The results of California statewide elections affirm a grassroots commitment to promote protect preserve and invest in strengthening the public benefits of our public school system for our communities and for all our children Whereas Voters approved of the school parcel tax measures that were on the ballot in California in Whereas Nine of the ten parcel tax or school bond measures on the ballot in Los Angeles County in November were approved by voters Whereas In June a majority of the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to reject a proposal to authorize a parcel tax in November despite favorable polling of likely voters in the June and November election cycles Whereas The Board has been directed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education to implement an aggressive fiscal stabilization plan for the District that should reasonably consist of plans for generating additional revenue as well as reductions in spending Whereas The Legislative Analyst Office for the State of California LAO is projecting a significant increase in Proposition funding for the fiscal year due to unexpectedly high tax revenues that is expected to generate a meaningful improvement to the Districts General Funds for the upcoming year Whereas A number of recent financial analyses of the Districts structural deficit has shown that about percent of declining enrollment and the associated declining revenue is due to excess proliferation of charter schools within the District Whereas Despite continued representations by charter school advocates that charter schools maintain long waitinglists of students seeking alternatives to District schools a recent report issued by the Charter School Division CSD revealed widespread under enrollment of charter schools operating in the District calling into question the Districts legislative priorities with regard to the efforts and advocacy required to modify outdated state law which allows unlimited new charter authorization and growth Whereas Underenrolled charter schools that are colocated at District facilities under Proposition are legally subject to monetary penalties that go mostly uncollected by the District Whereas The fiscal pressures on public school districts caused by the historic under funding of Special Education mandates could be alleviated by seeking a more equitable allocation of state funding in the following areas Inclusion of Special Education as an unduplicated pupil category for purposes of the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF funding The allocation of Special Education funding based on identified need rather than general enrollment and Board of Education Special Meeting Minutes am Distribution of funding based on average enrollment rather than Average Daily Attendance Whereas While philanthropic dollars and community partnerships are appreciated resources they are short term solutions because those monies fail to offer the District reliable predictable consistent and sustainable revenue sources resulting in reductions in academic programs and services for students when those dollars reach the end of the grant cycle Whereas The recent establishment of the Fund for Equity and Excellence has resulted in donated funds being directed primarily to consulting companies with expertise in leveraging debt and imposing austerity measures for private industry equity firms and to a lesser degree educational organizations with a goal of reimagining the District Whereas The Board is soon going to be asked to make profound and far reaching decisions regarding the financial and organizational future of public education in Los Angeles now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to submit a comprehensive threeyear enterprise plan and timeline by March that details sincere and efficacious strategies likely to increase District revenues including but not limited to enrollment stabilization and growth parcel tax and school bond measures property tax reform legislative and executive advocacy at the local state and federal level and philanthropic support Mr Schmerelson seconded the motion The following speaker addressed the Board Ms Cecily Myart Cruz UTLA Following the speaker and by general consent the resolution was adopted as amended The final version of the resolution reads as follows Mr Schmerelson Mr McKenna Mr Melvoin Ms Gonez Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles Res Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to submit a comprehensive threeyear enterprise plan and timeline by March that details sincere and efficacious strategies likely to increase District revenues including but not limited to enrollment stabilization and growth parcel tax and school bond measures property tax reform legislative and executive advocacy at the local state and federal level and philanthropic support Board of Education Special Meeting Minutes am The following resolution was withdrawn Mr Melvoin Ms Garcia Strategic Planning for Adequate Funding of Public Education in Los Angeles for All Kids Res Postponed from December Whereas Everyone in the Los Angeles Unified School District family is here to help kids succeed and all students families teachers employees and community members in Los Angeles stand to benefit from planning to increase revenue to the District regardless of political preference or divisive politics regarding school choice now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified
