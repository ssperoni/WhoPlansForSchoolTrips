deportation cases for unaccompanied minors residing within LAUSD boundaries on a pro bono basis with assistance from District staff Board Member Resolutions For Action Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in TO BE POSTPONED Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer Investing Strategically in Expanding K Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating K dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee including but not limited to Allocating resources to schools to allow a lower norm of students per teacher in grades and Providing curriculum specialists to oversee support and guide curriculum design and professional development at dual language schools Provide support and incentives to the current pool of teachers and substitutes who are seeking Bilingual Crosscultural Language and Academic Development BCLAD certificates or need training and maintain and expand paraprofessional career ladder for BCLAD candidates Provide school level planning time for dual language teachers Incentives to create K dual immersion instructional pathways in every Board District and be it finally Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the February March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Ms Ratliff Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Noticed January am Whereas While students in grades and throughout

Test SBAC is planning to release scores from the Spring SBAC assessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District

of Education and that the appropriate personnel from the Los Angeles Unified School Districts Office of Governmental Relations be directed to timely meet with the aforementioned State officials and advocate for the Boards position Board Member Resolutions For Initial Announcement Dr McKenna Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Celebration of Black History Month Res For Action February Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in US history Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every US president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of Freedom Summer a voter registration project in Mississippi part of

the th anniversary of The Civil Rights Act of the nations benchmark civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin Passage of the Act ended the application of Jim Crow laws in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be separate but equal was constitutional Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters and Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the theme to be A

isolation is a problem that affects far too many youth in our middle schools Whereas Social isolation can all too often be a precursor to teasing bullying and even violence to oneself and others Whereas Beyond Differences was established in to create an end to social isolation by changing the culture of middle school Whereas Beyond Differences is dedicated to the proposition that all students should feel included valued and accepted by their peers Whereas Beyond Differences has had a tremendous impact because it is a teenled social movement which emphasizes peer to peer training and schoolbased activities Whereas wwwnooneeatsaloneorg is being used as a web tool to sign up schools to encourage their participation Whereas Beyond Differences Teen Board has been leading middle school assembly programs for four years and has presented to nearly students and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas Beyond Differences is leading National No One Eats Alone Day Spread the Love on February now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of Los Angeles Unified School District joins Beyond Differences in proclaiming February National No One Eats Alone Day and encourages all middle schools to join in this effort and hold a No One Eats Alone on their campus Mr Zimmer Support of Compliance with Fair Labor Practices for Agricultural Vendors Res For Action February Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has learned that Gerawan Farming has had contracts with the District and is currently under consideration for further contracts Whereas In Gerawan Farming workers invoked a California law allowing neutral state appointed mediators to decide union contracts when employers refuse to sign them and in late the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board ALRB ordered that the threeyear contract was to take immediate effect Whereas Since workers requested the state mediator the ALRB general counsel has filed five complaintstantamount to indictmentsaccusing Gerawan Farming of illegally excluding some of its farm workers from the benefits of a [union contract] illegally instigating and encouraging the gathering of signatures on petitions to decertify the UFW unlawfully interrogating workers about their union activities and surveilling workers failing to bargain in good faith with its employees union intimidating [employees] in the exercise of their right to participate in negotiations and failing to implement the stateissued union contract Whereas Gerawan Farmings refusal to implement the

Report DESEGREGATION IMPACT STATEMENT DIS KIPP COMIENZA COMMUNITY PREP BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January I Category of Proposed Action The proposed action would renew the charter for KIPP Comienza Community Prep beginning July until June to serve students in grades K in each year of its charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter of KIPP Comienza Community Prep for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed

Report DESEGREGATION IMPACT STATEMENT DIS KIPP EMPOWER ACADEMY BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January Category of Proposed Action The proposed action would renew the charter for KIPP Empower Academy beginning July until June to serve students in grades K in each year of its charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter ofKIPP Empower Academy for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options identified If the District Courtordered Integration Guidelines are followed there will not be a negative effect on the Districts Courtordered

BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January As part of its renewal petition review process the Charter Schools Division has analyzed the performance of KIPP Empower Academy also referred to herein as Charter School in several key areas including but not limited to the following Student Discipline District schools must comply with the California Education Code requirements regarding student discipline suspension and expulsion LAUSDauthorized independent charter schools must comply with the provisions related to student discipline suspension and expulsion that are set forth in the District Required Language for Independent Charter Petitions New and Renewal and Material Revisions DRL DRL is included in all LAUSDapproved charter school petitions The Charter School has experience inconsistent spikes in student suspension for the past few years The Charter Management Organization CMO KIPP LA Schools attributes these fluctuations to multiple changes in school leadership school relocation and a higher than normal teacher attrition rate all of which occurred in the past two years alone To reduce student suspensions the school leaders continues to implement increased character education efforts consistant implementation of positive behavior supports in the form of traditions ritutals and positive referrals systems As a result the Charter School has significantly lowered its number of suspensions over time Please see table below The school reports that it plans to continue its recent emphasis on implementing alternatives to suspension to ensure a more cohesive clear and effective process for all stakeholders SUSPENSION and EXPULSION KIPP Empower Academy Suspensions number of incidents Expulsions Based on the most recent school data available as of the date of this report

of its key strategies for success ensuring a safe caring and nurturingenvironment for all youth while some youth are continuously uprooted from the security of their schools andcommunities and sent to another country to endure further trauma they once escapedLAUSD has an opportunity to protect this vulnerable population by creating a unique public law programAdvocating for Youth Unaccompanied in Deportation Actions AYUDA wherein District attorneys andstaff would handle a limited number of deportation cases for unaccompanied children who reside withinLos Angeles Unified School DistrictPrinted on Page of powered by Legistar File RepVersionDistrict boundaries Staff would interview clients collect evidence draft and file legal documents and preparefor and appear in court proceedingsThis program would bolster community confidence in District schools as safe havens and would present analternative source of legal assistance to unaccompanied youth who might view a school district as one of theonly institutions they can trustInitially the AYUDA program would entail one case per volunteer District attorney The most complicatedcases would be estimated to take about hours each with an approximate average of hours per caseoverall Cases would require approximately hours per week on average It is anticipated that Districtattorneys would participate in this program at a timeThe cost to the District would be negligible Volunteer attorneys would continue to meet the same needs oftheir District clients as before which would require these attorneys to complete some of their traditional dutiesafter hours andor on weekendsVolunteer attorneys would be drawn from District employees along with other volunteer case services egparalegals legal assistants interpreters social workers and forensic interviewers all as needed to support acase Legal training would be provided free of charge from organizations that have experience representingunaccompanied youth Also each District attorney would be paired with a volunteer immigrationdeportationexpert as a mentorAYUDA would be a replicable model program that could save the lives of some of the Districts mostvulnerable studentsExpected OutcomesDuring the school year District staff would design and implement a public law program whereinDistrict attorneys and staff would handle a limited number of deportation cases for children who came to theUnited States unaccompanied and now reside within LAUSD boundaries This program could help prevent thedeportation of unaccompanied children who have valid arguments for remaining in the

state of California approved Proposition in Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercialpropertiesWhereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change ofownershipWhereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change ofownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments lessoftenWhereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting theportion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percentWhereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schoolsWhereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and throughsubsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schoolsWhereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fairmarket value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for alonger time pay disproportionately lower property tax ratesWhereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has alarger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the USWhereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educateWhereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York thathave smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged studentsWhereas Among states California

SBACassessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of theLos Angeles Unified School District supportsWhereas However a likely result of the abovementioned lack of preparation with the testing devicesand testing medium is that scores on the Spring SBAC assessments in the District may not beindicative of student achievement instructional quality or fidelity to the new Common Core StateStandards that the assessments seek to measureWhereas In light of the forgoing it would be patently unfair to use the Spring SBAC assessmentresults for high stakes accountability purposes with respect to the students teachers and schools of theDistrict and any other school districts in a similar situation andWhereas Superintendent Ramon Cortines has

December am Ms Garca Mr Zimmer Uniting Families and Strengthening America Res For Action December Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District has the responsibility to protect the educational rights of all children and serve those who comply with laws that mandate compulsory education Whereas Our success as a District depends on students that are ready to learn families that encourage learning outside of the classroom educators and support staff with high expectations of success and a community that demands percent graduation Whereas The District embraces all students and families regardless of citizenship on their quest for the American dream Bd of Ed Regular Board Meeting CS Minutes am Whereas Like education citizenship is an important symbol of full membership and participation in society that should be encouraged not barred Whereas When the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program was initiated the District responded to the call with solutions to improve records systems and support for current and former students to obtain their school transcripts Whereas The District launched the Student Enrollment and Placement Assistance SEPA Center to facilitate enrollment and adaptation to newly arriving immigrant students to District schools Whereas Partner organizations have held many DACA informational workshops across the District educating hundreds of students and families that would qualify for the program Whereas Labor community and faith based organizations continue to band together to stand as one to provide these children and their families dignity and justice Whereas Our District family of students parents teachers educators and support staff continue to assist in the dissemination of information and resources for our impacted families and stand ready to assist with President Obamas most recent action Whereas Students should not be punished for their immigration status Instead they should be given recognition for their sacrifice hard work and determination Whereas President Obamas executive action to address this immigration crisis including the expansion of DACA the opportunity for work permits and reducing the likelihood for family separations will benefit many District families Whereas This executive action is a victory for a broad coalition of immigrant rights labor and student activists like our DREAMers across the nation and here in Los Angeles the epicenter of the immigrant rights movement Whereas Our District will be ready once again to help eligible students and their families Whereas Immigration is a federal responsibility and a comprehensive approach to solve our broken immigration system would strengthen our District and the economy of our country and allow aspiring citizens to make an even greater contribution to our communities Whereas The executive action is a step in the right direction and we continue to require a permanent Comprehensive Immigration Reform solution from Congress Whereas We hope to see the day when the children we welcome in the District will be equally embraced in our society and that the lessons we teach in our classrooms about equality inclusion and tolerance no longer contradict the laws that govern our country now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Board Meeting CS Minutes am Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District stands in solidarity with President Obamas executive action on immigration reform and encourages subsequent measures that will involve even more families in relief from deportation Resolved further That the Board exhorts Congress to pass a permanent solution to fix our broken immigration system Resolved further That the Board embraces the opportunity to work with the federal government and partner organizations to coordinate and collaborate as it relates to this executive action Resolved further That the Superintendent prepare all options to assist eligible students and their families for President Obamas executive action on immigration when the application and guidelines are released by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Resolved further That the Board requests that the Superintendent work with the Office of Instruction and the Student Involvement Development and Empowerment Unit to develop a plan for engaging high school students to become a volunteer force to assist families and eligible applicants in the information and application process around the executive action and be it finally Resolved That a copy of this resolution be sent to

Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA District staff evaluated space in the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Several other charter schools also requested space in the same ESC as Charter School The Districts Local Districts have been reorganized into ESCs School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report At the middle school level School setasides are used for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial The District school bus program has

According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Walking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical

the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Id A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school the CAC and the California Department of Public Health support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an

District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a

sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each

funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic

identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Id A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school the CAC and the California Department of Public Health support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely

attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each

funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher

lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and

enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each

available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each

ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and

prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted

activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school

of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined

case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS

Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the

system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school

national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The

of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District

Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools

centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education

have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of

With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students

pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing

assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children

of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict

pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing

conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly

Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as

achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the

with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING

implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to

a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS

Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing

many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies

student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their

making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas

Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of

be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance

eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor

poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have

Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas

Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and

prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate

teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools

of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to

a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic

geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular

for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and

the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an

District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student safety and welfare Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report ATTACHMENT TAB b Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas The District can make a complete and contiguous multisite offer to accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA therefore be it Resolved That pursuant to California Code of Regulations title section subdivision d for the reasons set forth herein and as further expressed by District staff the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District finds that the District cannot accommodate Charter School at a single school site and therefore be it finally Resolved That pursuant to Education Code sections and California Code of Regulations title section et seq

basis with assistance from District staff POSTPONED TO THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING OF Board Member Resolutions For Action Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in POSTPONED TO THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING OF Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer Mr Kayser Investing Strategically in Expanding PreK Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February ADOPTED AS AMENDED Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating PreK dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee and be it finally Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Ms Ratliff Ms Galatzan Mr Zimmer Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Noticed January am Whereas While students in grades and throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in the Spring Field Test of Math and English Language Arts assessments by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium SBAC students and schools received no results from SBAC from the assessments ADOPTED AS AMENDED BY CONSENT VOTE Whereas Following the Spring SBAC Field Test the District collected testing devices from its school sites is experiencing significant delays in returning the devices to the school sites and has not yet deployed the additional testing devices that the District has determined are required for the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Although thousands of teachers and administrators are working very hard to prepare students for the transition to the new standards for reasons outside of their control students teachers and principals in the District will not have had sufficient time to work with their testing devices and prepare for the mechanics of the new testing medium in advance of the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Unlike the Field Test SBAC is planning to release scores from the Spring SBAC assessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports Whereas However a likely result of the abovementioned lack of preparation with the testing devices and testing medium is that scores on the Spring SBAC assessments in the District may not be indicative of student achievement instructional quality or fidelity to the new Common Core State Standards that the assessments seek to measure Whereas In light of the forgoing it would be patently unfair to use the Spring SBAC assessment results for high stakes accountability purposes with respect to the students teachers Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm and schools of the District and any other school districts in a similar situation and Whereas Superintendent Ramon Cortines has requested that State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the State of California not use the Spring SBAC testing results for any high stakes accountability measures and that any data or scores derived from SBAC testing not have a negative impact on state andor federal funds that are allocated to the students of the District now therefore be it and Whereas The California State Board of Education SBE is scheduled to meet January to discuss Californias SBAC assessments including the reporting of student performance and progress results now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby urges the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California State Board of Education to not use the Spring SBAC assessment results to make any judgments regarding the Districts students teachers or schools and be it finally Resolved That a copy of this resolution and word of its approval be promptly delivered to State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the California State Board of Education in advance of the January SBE meeting and that the appropriate personnel from the Los Angeles Unified School Districts Office of Governmental Relations be directed to timely meet with the aforementioned State officials and advocate for the Boards position including during the January SBE meeting Board Member Resolutions For Initial Announcement Dr McKenna Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Celebration of Black History Month Res Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in US history FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every US president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Last year

prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin Passage of the Act ended the application of Jim Crow laws in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be separate but equal was constitutional Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters and Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the theme to be A Century of Black Life History and Culture now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black American History Month Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all of the people of the United States are the

of Black Americans Dr Vladovic Ms Galatzan National No One Eats Alone Day Res Whereas Social isolation is a problem that affects far too many youth in our middle schools FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas Social isolation can all too often be a precursor to teasing bullying and even violence to oneself and others Whereas Beyond Differences was established in to create an end to social isolation by changing the culture of middle school Whereas Beyond Differences is dedicated to the proposition that all students should feel included valued and accepted by their peers Whereas Beyond Differences has had a tremendous impact because it is a teenled social movement which emphasizes peer to peer training and schoolbased activities Whereas wwwnooneeatsaloneorg is being used as a web tool to sign up schools to encourage their participation Whereas Beyond Differences Teen Board has been leading middle school assembly programs for four years and has presented to nearly students and Bd of Ed

Alone on their campus Mr Zimmer Dr Vladovic Support of Compliance with Fair Labor Practices for Agricultural Vendors Res Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has learned that Gerawan Farming has had contracts with the District and is currently under consideration for further contracts FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas In Gerawan Farming workers invoked a California law allowing neutral state appointed mediators to decide union contracts when employers refuse to sign them and in late the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board ALRB ordered that the threeyear contract was to take immediate effect Whereas Since workers requested the state mediator the ALRB general counsel has filed five complaintstantamount to indictmentsaccusing Gerawan Farming of illegally excluding some of its farm workers from the benefits of a [union contract] illegally instigating and encouraging the gathering of signatures on petitions to decertify the UFW unlawfully interrogating workers about their union activities and surveilling workers failing to bargain in good faith with its employees union intimidating [employees] in the exercise of their right to participate in negotiations and failing to implement the stateissued union contract Whereas Gerawan Farmings refusal to implement the contract means its roughly employees have not been paid many millions of dollars they are owed by Gerawan Farming from July to July and many millions of dollars more over the contracts duration now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District calls upon Gerawan Farming to comply with state and federal laws including labor relations anti discrimination and minimum wage and hour laws and to immediately implement the agreement issued by the neutral mediator and the State of California Resolved further That the Board ensures that agricultural vendors and suppliers be in compliance with all local state and federal laws including the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and be it finally Resolved That the Procurement Services Division report back to the Board updating Gerawan Farmings compliance with fair labor practices before any contracts with this vendor are brought to the Board for approval Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolution Requested by the Superintendent

GEORGE J MCKENNA III MNICA RATLIFF STEVEN ZIMMER December The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District South Beaudry Avenue Los Angeles California Dear Board Members The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Los Angeles Unified School District District for the fiscal year ended June is hereby submitted Responsibility for both the accuracy of the presented data

and is reported in a manner designed to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the District All disclosures necessary to enable the reader to gain an understanding of the Districts financial activities have been included The report also includes a State and Federal Compliance Information section which is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the Office of the California State Controller the US General Accounting Office the US Office of Management and Budget and the Single Audit Act Amendments of Independent Audit EC provides that each school district shall arrange for an audit by certified public accountants of its books and accounts including the Districts income by source of funds and expenditures by object and program The Districts contract auditor for is Simpson Simpson CPAs The independent auditors report on the basic financial statements is presented in the Financial Section of this report on page Management Discussion and Analysis MDA The MDA provides an objective and easily readable analysis of the Districts financial activities on both a short and longterm basis This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MDA and should be read in conjunction with it The Districts MDA can be found immediately following the report of the independent auditors Profile of the Los Angeles Unified School District The District encompasses approximately square miles in the western section of Los Angeles County The District is located in and includes virtually all of the City of Los Angeles and all or significant portions of the cities of Bell Carson Commerce Cudahy Gardena Hawthorne Huntington Park Lomita Maywood Rancho Palos Verdes San Fernando South Gate Vernon and West Hollywood in addition to considerable unincorporated territories devoted to homes and industry The District was formed in as the Common Schools for the City of Los Angeles and became a unified school district in i As of June the District is operating elementary schools middlejunior high schools senior high schools options schools multi level schools special education schools magnet schools and magnet centers community adult schools regional occupational centers skills centers regional occupational program center early education centers infant centers and primary school centers The District is governed by a sevenmember Board of Education elected by district to serve alternating fouryear terms As of June the District employed certificated classified and unclassified employees Enrollment as of September was students in K schools students in adult schools and centers and children in early education centers As a reporting entity the District is accountable for all activities related to public education in most of the western section of Los Angeles County This report includes all funds of the District with the exception of the fiscally independent charter schools which are required to submit their own individual audited financial statements and the Auxiliary Services Trust Fund which is not significant in relation to District operations The Auxiliary Services Trust Fund was established in to receive and disburse funds for insurance premiums on student body activities and property all city athletic and musical events grants restricted for student activities and other miscellaneous activities Economic Condition and Outlook Below is a table to show unemployment rates for both the nation and the state of California For the month of October states that have significantly higher unemployment rates than the nation include Georgia at Mississippi at Rhode Island at and California at Californias October unemployment rate is the lowest since July Month January February March April May June July August September October US California P P Preliminary estimate Source Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey Nationwide the unemployment rate has improved from to from October to October States with the highest statistically significant change over this period are Illinois at Nevada at and Colorado at Californias yearoveryear change is from in October to in October in unemployment rate Californias economy has accelerated this year and is expected to its current momentum next year The forecast is that more jobs will be created in the US this year than in any year since dropping the unemployment rate to a year low According to UCLA Anderson Forecast the drought in California will have a marginal overall impact on agriculture in the State But School Services of California noted that the loss of average daily attendance that may result from the drought in communities that are hit by the loss of workers who leave the area due to a lack of work was not addressed However State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson ii announced that he will use his administrative authority to maintain school funding levels for districts impacted by the drought Noticeable uptick in the housing market the stock market and the labor market are signs of improving national and state economies The Legislative Analysts Office LAO forecasts a stronger California economy for than what was projected by the Department of Finance during the May Revision Budget which means a higher revenue forecast compared to the State Budget Act estimate for LAO predicts that all of the remaining K apportionment deferrals may terminate after fiscal year There may even be a partial pay down of the remaining state mandates backlog and Emergency Repair Program and additional funding for Common Core State Standards or the California Career Pathways Trust LAO also forecasted that the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF target entitlement may not be fully funded at the end of the eightyear implementation period as planned by the governor but several years thereafter The LAO forecast extends to which includes the years when the Proposition temporary increased taxes will expire The increase in sales tax rates will end in while the income tax increase on highincome earners will end in Although the expiration of these temporary taxes will reduce Proposition and directly impact support to education the total change in education funding would depend on the States economic climate before during and after the years when Proposition expires Superintendents Strategic Plan The Los Angeles Unified School District has developed five Key Strategies These strategies refer to the set of common sense approaches we will use to support the instructional core to help every LAUSD student achieve their maximum potential Transform teaching and learning so that we prepare all youth to graduate college and be workforce ready Ensure there is an effective employee at every level of the organization focused on improving student outcomes Provide a portfolio of high quality schools for all youth families and communities Ensure a safe caring and nurturing environment for all youth Operate an effective efficient and transparent organization in order to assure the public trust Financial Information The District maintains internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use and disposition and to provide reliable records for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes the importance of a close evaluation of costs and benefits which requires estimates and judgments by management The objective is to establish effective internal controls the cost of which should not exceed the benefits derived therefrom We believe that the Districts internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of proper recording of financial transactions School districts in California are required by Education Code Section to follow the California School Accounting Manual in preparing reports to the State The District in accordance with Board election on October utilizes a singleadoption budget schedule that requires Final Budget iii adoption by the Statemandated July deadline The District is allowed to modify its adopted budget within days of the passage of the State budget Education Code Section EC mandates that a school districts expenditures may not legally exceed budgeted appropriations by major object classification namely certificated salaries classified salaries employee benefits books and supplies services and other operating expenditures capital outlay other outgo and other financing uses EC further specifies that districts may not spend more than the amounts authorized in the Final Budget as adjusted during the fiscal year Encumbrance accounting to ensure effective budgetary control and accountability Unencumbered appropriations lapse at year end and encumbrances outstanding at that time are reported as assigned fund balance for subsequent year expenditures is utilized Financial Results In the Statement of Changes in Net Position shows that the Districts Net Position decreased by million during the year This includes a million restatement of beginning balance to reflect the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as a result of adopting Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities The Unrestricted Net Position which is negative declined from million to million The negative Unrestricted Net Position is largely the result of the Districts retiree health benefit liability OPEB liability The liability reflected which represents the previous years liability increased by the current years unfunded expense is million an increase of million from The latest actuarial report estimates the net present value of the entire year liability to be billion The District started to prefund its OPEB liability through an irrevocable Trust However the contribution made to the Trust is not enough to offset any existing or increase in the OPEB liability Hence it is projected that the Districts Total Liabilities will eventually exceed its Total Assets In the fund balance of the General Fund increased by million from million to million This increase is primarily due to higher apportionment received from Local Control Funding Formula sources brought about by the new revenue apportionment calculation Audit Results The District received an Unmodified financial audit An unmodified or clean opinion is issued when the auditor can state without reservation that the financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP For the federal compliance audit programs received an Unmodified audit and programs were Qualified The District received an Unmodified state compliance audit There were audit findings in The amount of the questioned costs declined from million in to million in Even with these improvements the District will continue to work with schools and offices to focus on resolving the remaining areas of internal control and compliance issues Awards The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada GFOA awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to Los Angeles Unified School District for its comprehensive annual financial report for the fiscal year ended June In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements iv A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only We believe that our current comprehensive annual financial report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Programs requirements and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate Acknowledgments We wish to express our appreciation to the Division of Accounting and Disbursements team the various District divisions who assisted

part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Districts internal control over financial reporting and compliance Los Angeles California December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June As management of the Los Angeles Unified School District we offer readers of the Districts financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal which can be found on pages iv of this report Financial Highlights The assets of the District exceeded its liabilities at the close of the most recent fiscal year by billion net position This amount is net of a billion deficit in unrestricted net position resulting primarily from the cumulative increase in unfunded liabilities for other postemployment benefits OPEB The Districts total net position decreased by million from prior year total primarily due to lower operating grants and contributions received As of the close of the fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of million from June At the end of the current fiscal year committed assigned and unassigned fund balances for the General Fund including reserve for economic uncertainties was million or of total General Fund expenditures The Districts total longterm obligations increased by million during the current fiscal year The increase resulted primarily from additional net OPEB obligation offset by the decrease in certificate of participation and general obligation bonds payable resulting from payment of matured debts and refunding Overview of the Basic Financial Statements This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Districts basic financial statements The Districts basic financial statements comprise three components governmentwide financial statements fund financial statements and notes to basic financial statements This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves Governmentwide financial statements The governmentwide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the Districts finances in a manner similar to a privatesector business The statement of net position presents information on all of the Districts assets deferred outflows of resources liabilities and deferred inflows of resources with the difference between these elements as net position Over time increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating The statement of activities presents information showing how the Districts net position changed during the most recent fiscal year All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs regardless of the timing of related cash flows Thus revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Each of the governmentwide financial statements relates to functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues governmental activities The governmental activities of the District are all related to public education The governmentwide financial statements can be found on pages of this report Fund financial statements A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives The District like other state and local governments uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with financerelated legal requirements All of the funds of the District can be divided into three categories governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds Governmental funds Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements However unlike the governmentwide financial statements governmental fund financial statements focus on nearterm inflows and outflows of spendable resources as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year Such information may be useful in evaluating a governments nearterm financing requirements Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the governmentwide financial statements it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements By doing so readers may better understand the longterm impact of the Districts nearterm financing decisions Both the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities The District maintains individual governmental funds In the governmental funds balance sheet and in the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances separate columns are presented for General Fund District Bonds Fund County School Facilities Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund and all other funds Individual account data for all other nonmajor governmental funds are provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this report The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the General Fund to demonstrate compliance with the budget The governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages and of this report Proprietary funds The District maintains Internal Service Funds as the only type of proprietary fund Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the Districts various functions The District uses internal service funds to account for Health and Welfare Benefits Workers Compensation SelfInsurance and Liability SelfInsurance Because all of these services benefit governmental functions they have been included within governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements It is the Districts practice to record estimated claim liabilities at the present value of the claims in conformity with the accrual basis of accounting for all its internal service funds The proprietary fund financial statements can be found on pages of this report Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Fiduciary funds Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the governmentwide financial statements because the resources of those funds are not available to support the Districts own programs The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds The fiduciary fund financial statements can be found on page of this report Notes to basic financial statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the governmentwide and fund financial statements The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages of this report Combining and individual fund schedules and statements Combining schedules and statements consisting of the budget to actual comparisons for District Bonds Fund County School Facilities Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund the individual accounts within the nonmajor governmental funds the internal service funds and the fiduciary funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information Combining and individual fund schedules and statements can be found on pages of this report Governmentwide Financial Analysis As noted earlier net position over time may serve as a useful indicator of a governments financial position In the case of the District assets plus deferred outflow of resources exceeded liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources by billion at the close of the most recent year By far the largest portion of the Districts net position billion reflects its investments in capital assets eg land buildings and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding The District uses these capital assets to provide services to students consequently these assets are not available for future spending Although the Districts investments in its capital assets are reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities The Districts restricted net position billion represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used The majority of this pertains to Federally Funded Programs The remaining negative balance in unrestricted net position billion resulted primarily from the recognition of billion of net OPEB obligation At the end of the fiscal year the District is able to report positive balances in all categories of net position except for unrestricted net position The million increase in capital assets net primarily relates to the continuing school construction and modernization projects throughout the District Longterm liabilities increased by million primarily due to additional net OPEB obligation offset by the decrease in certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable as a result of debt service payments and debt refunding to avail of lower interest rates Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Summary Statements of Net Position in thousands As of June and In the District adopted GASB Statement No which requires the restatement of the June net position in Governmental Activities The result is a decrease in net position at July of million See further discussion in Note p on pages of this report Continued As RestatedCurrent Assets Capital

Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Financial Analysis of the Governmental Funds As noted earlier the District uses fund accounting to facilitate compliance with financerelated requirements Governmental funds The focus of the Districts governmental funds is to provide information on nearterm inflows outflows and balances of spendable resources Such information is useful in assessing the Districts financing requirements Committed assigned and unassigned balances comprise the unrestricted fund balances and may serve as a useful measure of the Districts net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year As of the end of the current fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of million in comparison with the prior year Approximately million of this total combined ending fund balance constitutes unrestricted fund balance which is available for spending at the Districts discretion The remaining are either restricted or nonspendable and are not available for new spending restricted balances billion nonspendable inventories and revolving cash million The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District At the end of the fiscal year the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund was million while the total fund balance is million As a measure of the General Funds liquidity it may be useful to compare both the unrestricted fund balance and the total fund balance to the total fund expenditures The unrestricted fund balance represents of the total General Fund expenditures while the total fund balance represents of that same amount The fund balance of the Districts General Fund increased by million during the current fiscal year This is primarily due to higher apportionment received from Local Control Funding Formula sources brought about by the new revenue apportionment calculation Other changes in fund balances in the governmental funds are detailed as follows in thousands The fund balance decreased during the current year for the District Bonds due to continued spending for school construction modernization projects and renovation and for the Bond Interest Redemption Fund primarily from lower property taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bond issues plus a decrease in federal subsidy for the payment of interest On the other hand County School Facilities Bonds increased primarily due to fewer projects in progress causing a lower expenditure level Special Revenue increased primarily due to lower operating deficit from Adult Education Other Capital Projects increased primarily due to very minimal spending Continued CountySchoolBondOtherDistrictFacilitiesInterest andSpecialDebt CapitalBondsBondsRedemptionRevenueServiceProjectsTotalFund Balance June Nonspendable Restricted Committed Assigned Total Fund Balance July Increase decrease in fund balance Other Governmental Funds LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June of project funds combined with project cost transfers to other capital project accounts Debt Service has a very slight movement in the account This is primarily due to the offsetting effect of debt service payments and revenues derived from operating transfers from user funds and investment income Proprietary funds The Districts proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the governmentwide financial statements At the end of the year the Districts proprietary funds have unrestricted net position of million The net increase of million in the current year is primarily attributed to the increase in net position of the Health and Welfare fund as a result of slightly higher investment income and Medicare Part D subsidy that offsets its operating loss General Fund Budgetary Highlights Los Angeles Unified School District closely monitors and reviews its revenue and expenditure data to ensure that a sufficient ending balance is maintained This monitoring and review occurs from the development of the budgeted data through the Statemandated first and second interim financial reports and at year end utilizing the actual revenue and expenditure data Modified Final Budget vs Original Final Budget The Districts Original Final Budget is based on assumptions from the States May Revision Budget while the Modified Final Budget is based not only on the States May Revision Budget but also on all other known State budgetary changes and changes to the Districts priority of program implementations andor planned expenditures Differences between the General Fund Original Final Budget adopted by the Board of Education in June and the Modified Final Budget resulted in a lower budgeted ending balance by million from million to million Adjustments to the Original Final Budget were a decrease in beginning balance by million a decrease in budgeted revenues by million an increase in other financing sources by million and an increase in budgeted expenditures and other financing uses by million The decrease in beginning balance by million was to reflect the actual ending balance as of June as opposed to the estimated June ending balance The net decrease in budgeted revenues and other financing sources of million was mainly due to reduced estimated Other State revenues from grants The estimated expenditures and other financing uses remained at about the same level with a variance of only million Actual vs Modified Final Budget The beginning balance remained the same on both the actual and the Modified Final Budget The unfavorable variance of million in revenues and other financing sources between the actual and Modified Final Budget was primarily due to multiyear grants budgeted in their entirety but earned only to the extent of actual expenditures incurred The favorable variance of million in expenditures and other financing uses between the actual and the Modified Final Budget was due to lower than anticipated expenditures across all major objects of expenditures The largest decreases in expenditures were mainly in Certificated Salaries million Books and Supplies Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June million and Services and Other Operating Expenditures million Lastly Transfers Out decreased by million Capital Assets and Debt Administration Capital assets The Districts investment in capital assets for its governmental activities as of June amounts to billion net of accumulated depreciation a increase from the prior year The investment in capital assets includes sites improvement of sites buildings and improvements equipment and construction in progress net of any related accumulated depreciation The increase is primarily due to various building additions and modernizations that were completed at a cost of million Four new schools were opened in fiscal year Summary of capital assets net of accumulated depreciation is as follows in thousands Additional information on the Districts capital assets can be found in Note on pages of this report Longterm obligations At the end of the current fiscal year the District had total longterm obligations of billion Of this amount billion comprises debt to be repaid by voterapproved property taxes and not by the General Fund of the District Summary of longterm obligations is as follows in thousands Continued Sites Improvement of sites Buildings and improvements Equipment Construction in progress Total Governmental ActivitiesGeneral Obligation Bonds Certificates of Participation COPs Capital Lease Obligations Childrens Center Facilities Revolving Loan Liability for Compensated Absences Liability for Other Employee Benefits Selfinsurance Claims Other Postemployment Benefits OPEB Total On July the District adopted GASB Statement No and reported deferred refunding charges under deferred outflows of resources The GO Bonds balance at July was adjusted to exclude the deferred refunding charges of millionGovernmental Activities LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June The Districts total longterm obligations increased by million during the current fiscal year The key factor in this increase was the recognition of additional net OPEB obligation and increase in legal cost accrual offset by the decrease in certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable resulting from payment of matured debts LongTerm Credit Ratings Moodys Investor Service Moodys and Standard and Poors SP currently rate the Districts General Obligation Bonds and Certificates of Participation COPs The District requested withdrawal of all Fitch ratings in September The Districts current underlying ratings on its general obligation bonds are Aaand AA from Moodys and SP respectively The Districts COPs are currently rated A and A by Moodys and SP respectively The District purchased municipal bond insurance andor reserve surety bond policies at the time of issuance for some of its COPs and bonds Moodys SP and Fitch assigned insured ratings of Aaa AAA and AAA respectively on said COPs and bonds at the time of issuance Subsequent to February the rating agencies downgraded the ratings of certain bond insurers including all of those who had issued bond insurance policies andor surety bonds on District issues State statutes limit the issuance of general obligation bond debt by a unified school district if the outstanding general obligation bonds are more than of its total taxable property The debt limitation for the District as of June is billion which is in excess of the Districts outstanding general obligation bond debt after reflecting assets available in the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund for payment of principal Additional information on the Districts longterm obligations can be found in Notes and on pages of this report Impact of Upcoming Standard Effective for FY the District will adopt Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions This statement changes accounting and financial reporting by state and local government for pensions One of the major changes in financial reporting is that state and local governments are now required to recognize net pension liability and a more comprehensive measure of pension expense This will have a significant impact in the Districts net position of the governmentwide financial statements as a result of an existing large unfunded liability in the pension plan The amount will be determined and disclosed in next years CAFR reporting Requests for Information This financial report is designed to provide a general overview

However in the statement of activities the cost of those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense Some of the capital assets acquired this year were financed with capital leases The amount financed is reported in the governmental funds as a source of financing On the other hand the proceeds are not revenues in the statement of activities but rather constitute longterm liabilities in the statement of net position Proceeds of new debt and repayment of debt principal are reported as other financing sources and uses in the governmental funds but constitute additions and reductions to liabilities in the statement of net position Premiums and discounts are reported as other financing sources and uses in the governmental funds but presented as liabilities net of amortization in the statement of net position Because some property taxes will not be collected for several months after the Districts fiscal year ends they are not considered available revenues for this year In the statement of activities compensated absences and other retirement benefits are measured by the amounts the employees earned during the year In the governmental funds however expenditures for these items are measured by the amount of financial resources used essentially the amounts actually paid Interest on longterm debt in the statement of activities differs from the amount reported in the governmental fund because interest is recognized as an expenditure in the funds when it is due and thus requires the use of financial resources In the statement of

means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay current liabilities Application of the susceptibility to accrual criteria requires consideration of the materiality of the item in question and due regard for the practicality of accrual as well as consistency in application Federal revenues and State apportionments and allowances are determined to be available and measurable when entitlement occurs or related eligible expenditures are incurred Secured and unsecured property taxes related to debt service and community redevelopment purposes that are estimated to be collectible and receivable within days of the current period are recorded as revenue Investment income is accrued when earned All other revenues are not considered susceptible to accrual Continued

the substantive plan the plan as understood by the employer and the plan members and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs as applicable between the employer and plan members to that point The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce the effects of shortterm volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets if any consistent with the longterm perspective of the calculations In the July actuarial valuation the actuarial method used in estimating the liability is the Level Percentage of Pay Entry Age Normal EAN cost method which spreads plan costs for each participant from entry date to the expected retirement date Under this EAN cost method the plans normal cost is developed as a level percentage of pay spread over the participants working lifetime The significant assumptions used in the computation include a discount rate inflation of per annum and healthcare cost trend rates in of or for nonMedicare advantage plans and or for Medicare advantage plans The rate varies depending on the participants choice of healthcare provider ie Anthem Blue Cross Kaiser Health Net or UHC Ultimately the assumed rates decline to across the board in A healthcare cost trend rate of is assumed for dental and vision The

eligibility Of the students tested students were selected for verification of their English Language Acquisition Status ELAS designation of English Learner EL in accordance with procedure a of the audit guide The ELAS designations include English Learner EL English Only EO Reclassified Fluent English Proficient RFEP or Initially English Proficient Student IFEP Students who are determined to be EL can be reclassified based on completion of required measures Reclassification is the process by which the District determines if students who are EL have acquired sufficient proficiency in English to perform successfully in core academic subjects without English Language Development ELD support Successful reclassification would lead to the students ELAS designation changing to either RFEP or IFEP Based on our testing we noted that four students from four schools were incorrectly reported in CALPADS as EL as of the census date October One student was reclassified by the school prior to the census date but the District did not change the designation until after the census date As a result this student was incorrectly reported as EL and should be excluded from the Districts Unduplicated Pupil Count UPC For one student the school was unable to provide the supporting documentation for the EL designation According to the schools official the California English Language Development Test CELDT was not returned by the state vendor Thus a hand score had to be performed by the school However the Student Score Sheet was not retained As a result we are unable to verify the students EL designation For two students multiple records were keyed into the CALPADS to enter the student initial EL designation subsequent reclassification of the EL designation and other demographic data Due to CALPADS functionality the subsequent changes to the EL designation inputted into CALPADS were override by the original entry of EL As a result two students were incorrectly reported as EL and should be excluded from the Districts UPC LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs June The four exceptions noted were extrapolated to the EL population based on the error rate of the samples selected The following is a summary of the exceptions noted in our testing and the extrapolated impact on the Districts UPC and UPP School Total Enrollment UPC UPP Los

Questioned Costs section for additional details In addition to the previously mentioned exceptions we noted that students from schools were incorrectly reported in CALPADS as EL as of the census date Although these students were incorrectly reported as EL these students qualified for FRPM and could have been included in the Districts UPC As such there were no adjustments to the Districts UPC related to these students Questioned Costs We determined the total impact of the four findings on the District by extrapolating the noted errors to the total UPC We determined that the total extrapolated impact on the Districts UPC is students We decreased the Districts UPC by the extrapolated impact of students and calculated an Adjusted UPC of We applied the Adjusted UPC to the Districts LCFF State Aid Adjusted for Minimum State Aid Guarantee for fiscal year and we computed total questioned costs to be Recommendation We recommend that the School Information Branch of the District provide updates and training to the staff regarding data entry requirements of CALPADS Additionally staff inputting records into CALPADS should validate the accuracy of the data entered and accepted by the system Further the Districts schools should followup with the state vendor regarding unreturned tests which are used in determining the students EL eligibility and should retain a copy of the hand calculated Student Score Sheet as supporting documentation LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs June Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions The School Information Branch will provide training to staff on the data reporting requirements of CALPADS by February In addition the Districts policy document for EL eligibility

Weakness State Audit Guide Finding Code Recommendation We recommend that the initial determination of what projects should be recorded to Object Capital Outlay and the evaluation determination and documentation related to the completion of projects be performed by employees with adequate knowledge of the financial accounting for such assets The Districts Financial Reporting Division should establish new and improved policies and procedures with proper oversight by employees with adequate knowledge to ensure that the CIP account is analyzed and reconciled on a timely basis by project level The analysis should validate that completed projects are moved timely from CIP to the appropriate fixed asset account to be depreciated projects remaining in CIP at yearend represent projects required to be capitalized in accordance with GAAP repair projects which do not meet the accounting standards to be capitalized are timely expensed cancelled projects are timely expensed and all costs in CIP have been properly allocateddirect charged to each project Current Status Facilities Services Division Facilities in collaboration with Finance Information Technology Division ITD and Integrated Library and Textbook Support Services Library developed the Project Capitalization Policy for use on districtwide capital programs The document has been reviewed and was finalized and approved on July It provides guidelines and procedures for capitalization of fixed assets including trigger for recording beneficial use to begin service life of the asset for depreciation purposes Facilities ITD and Library identified staff in their respective departments with responsibilities for project accounting and reporting of capital assets and periodic review of asset reports The staff was provided training in June The first session focused on project capitalization while the second session covered use of SAP reports to display asset data and to determine if projects are appropriately set for capitalization Further training is planned for new staff and to review lessons learned from the asset settlement process Facilities has combined various data files and created an Asset Capitalization Master file to track project capitalization activities Data is still being cleansed and consolidated Once the file is completed the information will be integrated into COLIN

Los Angeles California Members of the Board In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the Los Angeles Unified School District District as of and for the year ended June in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America we considered the Districts internal control over financial reporting internal control as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control Accordingly we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified Given these limitations during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses However material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified We did identify certain deficiencies in internal control described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs that we consider to be significant deficiencies as items FS through FS Although not considered to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses we also noted certain items during our audit which we would like to bring to your attention These comments are summarized in the following report to management on pages to Our observations and recommendations have been discussed with appropriate members of management and are intended to strengthen internal

functions and processes Impact In the event of major disruption the District will not be able to recover its critical accounting systems business operations and processes in a timely manner Recommendation A Business Continuity Plan should be developed This plan should address the requirements for alternative processing and timely recovery of mission critical IT services The plan should be tested on a regular basis to ensure that IT systems can be effectively recovered shortcomings are addressed and the plan remains relevant Management Response Progress has been made in developing the Disaster Recovery Business Continuity Program plans and they are expected to be completed by May The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments ML Construction in Progress and Transfers to Depreciable Capital Assets Observation Since the District has undertaken numerous construction projects to either repair or modernize existing school facilities and starting in to build new schools Facilities Program Support Services a branch within the Districts Facilities Services Division FSD facilitates the proper accumulation and recording of the costs related to construction projects The Information Technology Division ITD and Integrated Library and Textbook Support Services ILTSS facilitate proper accumulation and recording of the costs related to School Network Modernization Projects and Library Renovation Programs respectively ITD also is responsible for all internally developed software used by the District Construction in progress CIP is a District general ledger account that refers to the temporary classification of capital assets that are being builtassembleddeveloped before being placed in service The District tracks all its costs related to the buildingassemblydevelopment of such assets until the asset is completed The Districts formal policy for the determination of when an FSD project is completed is the Notice of Completion NOC which is filed with the Los Angeles County RegistrarRecorder Office For ITD School Network Modernization Projects the Test and Acceptance Form is the determination of completion Internally developed software is moved to completed projects when substantially completed and put in service For ILTSS projects the Budget Modification Form issued to close the project is the determination of completion During our testing of the costs accumulated in CIP and transfers to depreciable capital assets we noted that certain Facilities construction ITD and ILTSS projects amounting to million million and million respectively were completed during fiscal year but were still in CIP We also noted that trailing charges related to certain depreciable capital assets in the amount of million that remained in CIP have not been transferred to depreciable capital assets Depreciation expenses related to these completed projects amounted to million for fiscal year and million for prior fiscal years In addition we noted that certain projects with cumulative costs of million were completed in prior years but were transferred and recorded to depreciable capital assets during fiscal year The related deprecation expenses that should have been reported in prior years amounted to million Impact During fiscal year the District has established new and improved policies and procedures and conducted training for the analysis and reconciliation of the CIP accounts In its continuous effort to clean up the CIP accounts misclassification of construction in progress and depreciable capital assets were discovered that resulted in audit adjustments in depreciation expenses for fiscal year Recommendation We recommend that the FSD ITD and ILTSS departments dedicate sufficient staff resources to perform timely analysis and review of the CIP accounts The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments Management Response Management notes that there have been significant improvements in accounting for construction in progress and transfers to depreciable capital assets The District will continue the improvements by ongoing update of policies and procedures as needed providing basic and advanced training at least once a year and identifying issues and providing oversight to the settlement process and linking asset records to projects in the accounting system of record SAP ML Procurement of Construction Contracts Observation During our review of the internal controls over the Districts procurement procedures related to construction contracts we noted that a total of three out of procured construction contract samples were missing the Public Works Contracts PWC form Public works refers to construction projects that are paid for in whole or in part out of public funds The PWC form should be completed by the awarding body and submitted through the California Department of Industrial Relations DIR online access The completion and the submission of this form fulfills the required public works project award notification to both the Division of Apprenticeship Standards [Labor Code sec replacing former DAS notification and the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement Public Works Compliance Monitoring Unit [ Cal Code Reg sec a] The District in their effort to retrieve the PWC from the DIRs website was unable to access their prior submissions As a result the District was unable to support their preparation and submission of the PWC Impact Failure to submit the PWC to the DIR would result in noncompliance with the respective labor code Recommendation The District should adhere to the reporting requirements set forth by the DIR and retain supporting documentation of the submission Management Response Management concurs The Construction Contracts team will work to resolve issues with online access and submission of the online PWC forms In the interim Facilities Contracts will submit paper PWC forms to ensure compliance with this requirement The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments ML Procurement of Professional Services Observation Our review over the internal controls of the Districts procurement procedures related to Professional Services revealed a total of three task order contracts with procured vendors in which the District did not obtain a Due Diligence investigation andor background check in a timely manner Based on the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts revised in April The District will perform due diligence investigation andor background check of any Architectural Engineering AE or Professional Services firm planning to enter into a contract agreement with the District The thresholds and timing requirements for when the Due Diligence reports are to be requested are as follows For any one contract over million in value or multiple contracts for a single firm with a potential cumulative value of over million Facilities Contracts will request OIG to perform a Due Diligence Investigation The District may delay due diligence investigations for task order contracts until the cumulative assigned task orders approach the required limits This investigation will take approximately weeks to prepare and Facilities Contracts may use the results of this audit for up to two years after its completion The total cumulative value of assigned task orders for all three vendors procured reached the million threshold during Fiscal Year As of June the District has not requested the OIG to perform a Due Diligence Investigation for two of the three vendors procured upon the cumulative assigned task order reaching the required limit For one of the three vendors procured the District relied on a prior Due Diligence Investigation which was performed beyond the allowable two year window as per the requirement Impact Untimely review of procured vendors Due Diligence Investigation will delay the Districts response to potential issues which may arise from the investigation As it states in the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts upon review of the Due Diligence Investigation if there are any serious issues which are uncovered the Director of Facilities Contracts or his designee will conduct a responsibility hearing with the firm to validatediscard the issues raised If the responsibility hearing proves the firm is nonresponsible the Facilities Contracts will not issue any additional task orders to that firm until the contract expires Recommendation The District should adhere to the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts and perform Due Diligence Investigations based on the requirements The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments Management Response Management concurs Controls will be implemented to ensure that Task Order contracts that have reached in total contract value will have a Due Diligence performed to ensure that potential issues are addressed in a timely manner Management will review all task order contracts that have reached the threshold to ensure that Due Diligence reports are requested and reviewed by April The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Lack of Sufficient Authorization for SAP Program Changes Recommendation SAP Transport Request

management should implement program change control procedures that include documenting business sponsor ITD and user acceptance approval Current Status Corrective actions implemented Change control procedures have been documented ML Ineffective Accrual Procedures for ConstructionRelated Payments Recommendation The District should implement a systematic methodology or procedure to be used in determining what expenditures need to be recorded as accrued liabilities in the appropriate fiscal year especially for departments that involve high volume of expenditure transactions For constructionrelated expenditures where typically actual billings by vendors take place at a much later date from when the services are rendered project managers and other employees responsible for overseeing delivery of goods and services from third party vendors should be made responsible and held accountable to coordinate with FSD ITD and Accounts Payable Department in determining ongoing projects for which services have been rendered but have not been billed at yearend Alternatively these same project managersemployees may be assigned the responsibility to coordinate with third party vendors to encourage timely submission of billingsinvoices Actual billingsinvoices can then be the basis for the amount of expenditures to be accrued at yearend Current Status Corrective actionss implemented Facilities and ITD have made significant improvements to their procedures for accruing constructionrelated payments These improvements include better coordination between staff and vendors implementation of threewaymatch in the SAP accounting system recording of expense at GR posting and changes in accounting for retention These improvements substantially reduced missed construction accruals down to immaterial amounts in fiscal year The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Analysis of Accounts Receivable Overpayments Recommendation We recommend that the District continue implementing procedures to develop and maintain an organized subsidiary ledger of Accounts Receivable employee overpayments where overpayments and corresponding collections of these overpayments by employee are accounted for In that way the District has a better basis of determining the overpayments impact in the fund financial statements Current Status Corrective actionss implemented The District has developed and maintained subsidiary ledgers that detail the overpayment receivable by employee The Payroll Administrations management is in the process of implementing new wage types to track all overpayments and unrecoverable amounts The new wage types will post to the subsidiary ledgers and have information that reflects at the employee level the overpayments and corresponding collections made to the overpayments This will also serve to improve the process currently applied by the Districts management to assess the collectability of overpayments which are used to estimate the reserve for bad debts ML Construction in Progress and Transfers to Depreciable Capital Assets Recommendation We continue to recommend that the FSD perform a more thorough analysis of costs incurred for New Construction Existing Facilities and Library Services projects when deciding whether these projects are completed and are ready to be put into operation and therefore are to be depreciated Specifically the District should establish and implement a clearer policy that addresses proper identification of completed projects Currently FSDs trigger point in determining a projects completion is a notice of completion document for the projects primary construction contractors Supposedly this document denotes that a project is completed or substantially completed This information has to be verified by the facilities group and communicated to the General Accounting Branch Same for ITD projects ITD should thoroughly analyze all existing projects and evaluate each projects completion The results of the evaluation should be communicated as well to the General Accounting Branch for proper recording of the assets completion Current Status Corrective actions not implemented See ML of the Current Year Management Letter Comments The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Data Center Physical Access Recommendation Data Center access reports should be reviewed and signed periodically eg every to months by ITD management to identify and remove inappropriate physical access to the data center Current Status Corrective actions implemented Data Center access has been reviewed and documented ML IT Asset Inventory Management Recommendation An IT asset discovery tool should be implemented to support the management of IT asset inventory Current Status Corrective actions implemented ITD implemented BMCs

REPORT NO Los Angeles Trust for Childrens Health MOU Revision Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR ACTION Ms Ratliff Ms Galatzan Mr Zimmer Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Whereas While students in grades and throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in the Spring Field Test of Math and English Language Arts assessments by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium SBAC students and schools received no results from SBAC from the assessments Whereas Following the Spring SBAC Field Test the District collected testing devices from its school sites is experiencing significant delays in returning the devices to the school sites and has not yet deployed the additional testing devices that the District has determined are required for the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Although thousands of teachers and administrators are working very hard to prepare students for the transition to the new standards for reasons outside of their control students teachers and principals in the District will not have had sufficient time to work with their testing devices and prepare for the mechanics of the new testing medium in advance of the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Unlike the Field Test SBAC is planning to release scores from the Spring SBAC assessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports Whereas However a likely result of the above mentioned lack of preparation with the testing devices and testing medium is that scores on the Spring SBAC assessments in the District may not be indicative of student achievement instructional quality or fidelity to the new Common Core State Standards that the assessments seek to measure Whereas In light of the forgoing it would be patently unfair to use the Spring SBAC assessment results for high stakes accountability purposes with respect to the students teachers and schools of the District and any other school districts in a similar situation and Whereas Superintendent Ramon Cortines has requested that State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the State of California not use the Spring SBAC testing results for any high stakes accountability measures and that any data or scores derived from SBAC testing not have a negative impact on state andor federal funds that are allocated to the students of the District now therefore be it and Whereas The California State Board of Education SBE is scheduled to meet January to discuss Californias SBAC assessments including the reporting of student performance and progress results now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby urges the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California State Board of Education to not use the Spring SBAC assessment results to make any judgments regarding the Districts students teachers or schools and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That a copy of this resolution and word of its approval be promptly delivered to State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the California State Board of Education in advance of the January SBE meeting and that the appropriate personnel from the Los Angeles Unified School Districts Office of Governmental Relations be directed to timely meet with the aforementioned State officials and advocate for the Boards position

Mr Bryan Ramirez Perez Student This report was postponed to the Regular Board meeting of February BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR ACTION The following resolution was postponed to the Regular Board meeting of February Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer moved the following resolution Investing Strategically in Expanding K Dual Language Instructional Pathways Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating K dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Mr Kayser seconded the motion Superintendent Cortines responded to questions from Board Members regarding budget allocations and plans for expansion of duallanguage programs Remarks were heard from Board Members With the consent of the resolutions mover and seconder an amendment to change all occurrences of K to PreK was accepted as friendly After discussion and by general consent the resolution was adopted as amended Ms Garca was absent Later in the meeting Ms Garca recorded an aye vote on the resolution The final version of the resolution is as follows Mr Zimmer Mr Kayser Investing Strategically in Expanding PreK Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a

instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee and be it finally Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT The following resolutions will be for action at the Regular Board meeting of February Dr McKenna Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Celebration of Black History Month Res Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in US history Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every US president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of Freedom Summer a voter registration project in Mississippi part of a larger effort by civil rights groups such as the Congress on Racial Equality CORE and the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee SNCC to expand black voting in the South Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of The Civil Rights Act of the nations benchmark civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin Passage of the Act ended the application of Jim Crow laws in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be separate but equal was constitutional Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters and Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the theme to be A Century of Black Life History and Culture now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black American History Month Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all of the people of the United States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to us by Black culture and be it be finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Superintendent will work with educators librarians and all the schools of the District and the community to recognize and celebrate this month with appropriate programs ceremonies and activities that generate indepth discussions of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans Dr Vladovic Ms Galatzan National No One Eats Alone Day Res Whereas Social isolation is a problem that affects far too many youth in our middle schools Whereas Social isolation can all too often be a precursor to teasing bullying and even violence to oneself and others Whereas Beyond Differences was established in to create an end to social isolation by changing the culture of middle school Whereas Beyond Differences is dedicated to the proposition that all students should feel included valued and accepted by their peers Whereas Beyond Differences has had a tremendous impact because it is a teenled social movement which emphasizes peer to peer training and schoolbased activities Whereas wwwnooneeatsaloneorg is being used as a web tool to sign up schools to encourage their participation Whereas Beyond Differences Teen Board has been leading middle school assembly programs for four years and has presented to nearly students and Whereas Beyond Differences is leading National No One Eats Alone Day Spread the Love on February now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of Los Angeles Unified School District joins Beyond Differences in proclaiming February National No One Eats Alone Day and encourages all middle schools to join in this effort and hold a No One Eats Alone on their campus Mr Zimmer Dr Vladovic Support of Compliance with Fair Labor Practices for Agricultural Vendors Res Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has learned that Gerawan Farming has had contracts with the District and is currently under consideration for further contracts Whereas In Gerawan Farming workers invoked a California law allowing neutral state appointed mediators to decide union contracts when employers refuse to sign them and in late the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board ALRB ordered that the threeyear contract was to take immediate effect Whereas Since workers requested the state mediator the ALRB general counsel has filed five complaintstantamount to indictmentsaccusing Gerawan Farming of illegally excluding some of its farm workers from the benefits of a [union contract] illegally instigating and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm encouraging the gathering of signatures on petitions to decertify the UFW unlawfully interrogating workers about their union activities and surveilling workers failing to bargain in good faith with its employees union intimidating [employees] in the exercise of their right to participate in negotiations and failing to implement the stateissued union contract Whereas Gerawan Farmings refusal to implement the contract means its roughly employees have not been paid many millions of dollars they are owed by Gerawan Farming from July to July and many millions of dollars more over the contracts duration now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District calls upon Gerawan Farming to comply with state and federal laws including labor relations anti discrimination and minimum wage and hour laws and to immediately implement the agreement issued by the neutral mediator and the State of California Resolved further That the Board ensures that agricultural vendors and suppliers be in compliance with all local state and federal laws including the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and be it finally Resolved That the Procurement Services Division report back to the Board updating Gerawan Farmings compliance with fair labor practices before any contracts with this vendor are brought to the Board for approval MISCELLANEIOUS BUSINESS SPECIAL REPORTS The Board is in receipt of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Mr Crain made the following statement Ed

LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Proposals for Legislation in Preservation of Funding for K Adult Education Programs Source Division of Adult and Career Education Proposal Identify funding and programmatic changes that ensure school districts continue to receive funding for K adult education programs Additionally identify funding opportunities in a manner that recognizes school districts that sustained their adult education programs because of maintenance of effort requirements Rationale In the State Budget the state legislature approved a reorganization of how adult education services are provided in local communities AB requires Local Educational Agencies LEAs and community colleges to form regional consortia in order to receive state funds and create greater collaboration in serving this student population However there is no specificity on how funds will support specific adult education programs within a region This proposal seeks to preserve state funding to support K adult education programs while also providing clarity on how funds are distributed to the regional consortia Adult Education Funds for High School Education Source Division of Adult and Career Education Proposal Seek legislative changes to allow adult education funds to be used for programs that serve high school students Rationale Currently LAUSDs adult education includes credit recovery classes that serve approximately high school students However funding under AB specifically lays out five program areas where funds can be used and these areas do not cover programs that serve high school students Without the ability to direct a portion of state adult education funds to these programs LAUSD will be forced to use General Fund dollars to sustain these critical programs Specialized Programs at Charter Schools for Students with Disabilities Source Charter Schools Division Proposal Amend existing Charter school lottery procedures to provide preferences or exemptions for students with moderate to severe and low incidence disabilities who are expected to participate in a specific special education program operated by a Charter school Rationale Allowing charter schools to develop specialized programs to serve students with significant disabilities will provide an opportunity to create programs and services that are innovative meet the needs of a variety of students and provide increased options for these students to receive an education in more inclusive environments While many Charter schools would like to enroll these students and develop specialized programs that provide services to Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report meet their diverse needs the Charter school lottery system creates a barrier to this goal Currently Charter schools with a waitlist must implement a lottery for new enrollment Because of this the probability of a significant number of students with disabilities being chosen is slim Therefore allowing Charter schools to exempt students with disabilities from a lottery will create a mechanism that would allow these students to benefit from quality programs in smaller and more inclusive learning environments Elementary School Physical Education Requirements Source Office of General Counsel Proposal Amend statewide statutes regarding the number of hours required for physical education PE and mandate that complaints surrounding this issue be made through the Uniformed Complaint Procedures UCP process Rationale Education Code requires that elementary schools provide PE throughout the school year for a minimum of minutes per school days Many times schools are unable to meet this requirement due to unforeseen circumstances such as a school lockdown or a heat advisory In addition when circumstances arise that impede students from partaking in PE classes it is difficult to find the time to make up these hours Because of this LAUSD along with other school districts throughout California were named in a lawsuit that claims districts are not complying with the minute requirement Even though LAUSD is working to rectify the situation the lawsuit will be a significant cost to the District The District agrees with providing PE for all students however it cannot afford to pay for future predatory lawsuits that may arise due to this law Therefore this requirement should be amended to grant schools greater flexibility in complying with the law and to create a process where complaints would be received through the UCP process instead of legal action Unduplicated Count for Foster Youth Source Board of Education Proposal Seek legislative changes to the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF to allow for greater resources for foster youth students Rationale The LCFF established additional funding streams for three targeted groups of students foster youth English learners and lowincome students Under the new system supplemental grants and concentration grants are based on an unduplicated count of students within these groups Foster youth by definition are all lowincome students and therefore they are only counted once and we do not receive any additional funding for foster youth students However unlike lowincome and English learners students in the foster system typically came to the system because of traumatic events such as neglect and abuse Because of this foster youth have a distinct set of educational needs and require additional resources to ensure their needs are met Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Accounting for LowIncome Students at Provision Schools Source Office of the Chief Operating Officer Proposal Seek potential clarifications andor amendments to the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF requirements for the verification of lowincome students in Provision schools Rationale Under LCFF funding for school districts is determined by a formula that provides additional funding for lowincome Englishlearner and foster youth students CDE announced in August that districts would be required to certify annually all their lowincome students in order to receive additional funding for these students At many schools applications for free and reduced price meals FRPM can be used to identify lowincome students However at school sites that are designated federal Provision schools FRPM applications are collected only once every four years As a result these schools must instead collect an alternate income form once every four years to certify their lowincome students Once a base year is established for Provision schools the alternate income forms only need to be collected for newly enrolled students during the intervening years This presents a problem for schools because it is unclear if an incoming freshman student at a high school counts as a newly enrolled student If an incoming class is counted this can be an additional burden for these schools that have to constantly collect a large number of income verification forms every year even though the population served remains static Adequate Funding for K Education Source Board of Education Proposal Seek additional funding sources for K education to ensure every student receives a quality education Rationale Even with the new LCFF California schools are still severely underfunded The lack of funds hinders a districts ability to provide highquality education and increase achievement for all students Pursuing other sources of revenue will not only lead to a better education for students but also an increase in economic growth for the surrounding community Unfunded Liability of California State Teachers Retirement System CalSTRS Source Office of Chief Financial Officer Proposal Identify options to alleviate the financial impact felt by districts due to the increase in employer contributions to CalSTRS Rationale This year CalSTRS was about percent funded and had an unfunded liability of billion In order to pay down this debt employer contributions for CalSTRS will increase from to of payroll over the next seven years While this increase was necessary to address the funding deficiencies it will greatly impact the scarce resources of districts that increasingly are expected to provide more services with fewer resources Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Redevelopment Agency PassThrough Flexibility Source Office of the Chief Financial Officer Proposal Seek statutory clarification that will allow the District to use agreementbased redevelopment passthrough funding to pay for deferred maintenance personnel Rationale In a statutory change was adopted that clarified the Districts ability to use Redevelopment Agency RDA statutory passthrough funding for deferred maintenance purposes This proposal would make a similar and conforming change for RDA funding received from agreementbased passthrough funding Educator Effectiveness and Protecting Employee Due Process Source Office of General Counsel Proposal Work collaboratively with stakeholders in evaluating current statutes that dictate the probationary period the evaluation process and senioritybased layoffs and dismissals for certificated employees Rationale In the wake of the recent Vergara court ruling it is likely that the California Legislature will attempt to amend many of the employment statutes that apply to certificated employees In the event that that the Legislature moves forward with proposals to address these issues it is the intent of the District that we ensure the constitutional rights of our students to a quality education while preserving the due process rights of our employees Expansion of Californias Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act Source Board of Education Proposal To expand the Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act to include wine and liquor bottles on the list of beverages included in the California Redemption Value CRV program and direct the additional funds collected from these bottles to benefit Californias children Rationale Currently more than billion beverages sold in the state are exempt from paying CRV due to arbitrary regulations based on container size and liquid type Glass wine and liquor bottles are two of these beverages that are not included under Section of the Public Resources Code and thus do not qualify for the CRV program By closing this loophole and adding wine and liquor to the list of beverages included in the program it is estimated that uncollected deposits would increase the State fund by more than million The revenue gained from amending this law should be directed to programs that aim to benefit Californias children Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Extension of State School Facilities Program Source Facilities Division Proposal Extend the State School Facilities Program to ensure LAUSD can leverage its local bond dollars and address the multitude of facilities needs throughout the District Rationale The current State School Facilities Program has exhausted all funding for school construction Absent funding from the State local school districts will be required to shoulder the burden of funding of their school construction needs For many school districts that do not have access to local bond funds the state program is their only means of addressing their school facilities needs To ensure equity for all school districts and all school children the State School Facilities Program must be extended This will require the Legislature to authorize a ballot initiative for the ballot Public Works Projects Based on Best Value for School District Source Facilities Division Proposal Establish a year pilot program which would authorize the bid evaluation and selection for public works projects in excess of to be determined by the best value for the school district Also establish various requirements applicable to the use of the best value procurement method Rationale Public Contract Code requires the governing board of any school district seeking to issue a contract for a public works project to let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder who shall give security as the board requires The current procurement process restricts a school district from evaluating bidders based on factors other than price Some of those factors may include but are not limited to prior school construction experience previous violations of California or Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act standards disqualification or removal from a prior school construction job and financial stability Not being able to evaluate a bidder based on factors other than lowest price a school district is subjecting itself to significant change orders project delays and cost overruns due to a contractors inability to navigate the complicated school construction process Public Notification Flexibility for Public Works Contracts Source Facilities Division Proposal Expand the public notification methodology for which a school district is required to give public notice of a project to potential bidders Rationale Public Contract Code Section states for the purpose of securing bids the governing board of a school district shall publish at least once a week for two weeks in some newspaper of general circulation published in the district or if there is no such paper then in some newspaper of general circulation circulated in the county and may post on the districts Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report web site or through an electronic portal a notice calling for bids stating the work to be done or materials or supplies to be furnished and the time when and the place and the web site where bids will be opened The amount of staff time and resources required to prepare a newspaper advertisement for each public works contract the District seeks is very consuming and costly Over the past years the District has posted an average of advertisements each year at a cost ranging from to per advertisement In this age of technology school districts should be afforded the flexibility to either post in a local newspaper or on the districts website Amend Title for SelfPerform Design Reviews Source Facilities Division Proposal Authorize a school district under the jurisdiction of the Division of State Architect to selfperform design phase reviews and commissioning with appropriately certified staff Rationale Title requires a school district to engage with an independent rd party for design reviews where square footage exceeds or complex mechanical systems exceed sq ft California Administrative Code Title Part Section b and b Public agencies can selfinspect DSA projects with certified inhouse staff where LifeSafety issues are more prominent than with Title This proposal simply seeks to expand this capability to less critical projects Considering many public agencies currently have qualified inhouse staff to provide design reviews the current requirement forces public agencies to incur unnecessary costs for external design review Creditable Service in CalSTRS Source Office of Human Relations Proposal Update existing statutes that define creditable service in the CalSTRS system to be consistent with laws that define school employees who must have a Commission on Teacher Credentialing CTC credential Rationale Recently CalSTRS has deemed various LAUSD positions as not eligible for creditable service in CalSTRS This jeopardizes the retirement of many District employees who hold these positions and hampers the ability of the District to fill these positions Part of the problem is due to laws that require certain employees to hold a CTC credential but the statutes that define creditable service for CalSTRS do not capture these employees Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education December

deportation cases for unaccompanied minors residing within LAUSD boundaries on a pro bono basis with assistance from District staff Board Member Resolutions For Action Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in TO BE POSTPONED Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer Investing Strategically in Expanding K Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating K dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee including but not limited to Allocating resources to schools to allow a lower norm of students per teacher in grades and Providing curriculum specialists to oversee support and guide curriculum design and professional development at dual language schools Provide support and incentives to the current pool of teachers and substitutes who are seeking Bilingual Crosscultural Language and Academic Development BCLAD certificates or need training and maintain and expand paraprofessional career ladder for BCLAD candidates Provide school level planning time for dual language teachers Incentives to create K dual immersion instructional pathways in every Board District and be it finally Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the February March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Ms Ratliff Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Noticed January am Whereas While students in grades and throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in the Spring Field Test of Math and English Language Arts assessments by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium SBAC students and schools received no results from SBAC from the assessments Whereas Following the Spring SBAC Field Test the District collected testing devices from its school sites is experiencing significant delays in

to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in TO BE POSTPONED Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer Investing Strategically in Expanding K Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing

to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Meeting post Order of Business pm

Report DESEGREGATION IMPACT STATEMENT DIS KIPP COMIENZA COMMUNITY PREP BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January I Category of Proposed Action The proposed action would renew the charter for KIPP Comienza Community Prep beginning July until June to serve students in grades K in each year of its charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter of KIPP Comienza Community Prep for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options identified If the District Courtordered Integration Guidelines are followed there will not be a negative effect on the Districts

beginning July until June to serve students in grades K in each year of its charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter ofKIPP Empower Academy for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options identified If the District Courtordered Integration Guidelines are followed there will not be a negative effect on the Districts Courtordered

BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January As part of its renewal petition review process the Charter Schools Division has analyzed the performance of KIPP Empower Academy also referred to herein as Charter School in several key areas including but not limited to the following Student Discipline District schools must comply with the California Education Code requirements regarding student discipline suspension and expulsion LAUSDauthorized independent charter schools must comply with the provisions related to student discipline suspension and expulsion that are set forth in the District Required Language for Independent Charter Petitions New and Renewal and Material Revisions DRL DRL is included in all LAUSDapproved charter school petitions The Charter School has experience inconsistent spikes in student suspension for the past few years The Charter Management Organization CMO KIPP LA Schools attributes these fluctuations to multiple changes in school leadership school relocation and a higher than normal teacher attrition rate all of which occurred in the past two years alone To reduce student suspensions the school leaders continues to implement increased character education efforts consistant implementation of positive behavior supports in the form of traditions ritutals and positive referrals systems As a result the Charter School has significantly lowered its number of suspensions over time Please see table below The school reports that it plans to continue its recent emphasis on implementing alternatives to suspension to ensure a more cohesive clear and effective process for all stakeholders SUSPENSION and EXPULSION KIPP Empower Academy Suspensions number of incidents Expulsions Based on the most recent school data available as of the date of this report

years As the data shows KIPP Empower Academy a K school has served a fewer numbers of English Learners than the Resident Schools Median The school has had a flat record of reclassification because students in grades K are not considered for reclassification and because the school requires two years of ELA proficiency on the Standardized Testing and Reporting STAR test As a result English Learners were not reclassificed due to the suspension of the STAR Test in However starting this year KIPP LA Schools the CMO that operates KIPP Empower Academy adjusted its reclassification criteria

action would renew the charter for Para Los Nifios Evelyn Thurman Gratts Primary Center beginning July until June to serve up to students in grades TK throughout its charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter of Para Los Nifios Evelyn Thurman Gratts Primary Center for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options identified If the District Courtordered Integration Guidelines are followed there will not be a negative effect on the Districts Courtordered Integration Program CLAUDIA M LARA ED D Specialist Charter Schools Division Bd of Ed Rpt No Page

schools program consists of a mildmoderate Special Day Classroom and services in RSP and Speech and Language while also subcontracting for other services as needed based on individual IEPs PLN Gratts

English Learner Master Plan The data tables below provide the number and percentage of English Learners identified served and reclassified by Charter School over the last three years The Charter School currently serves TK students As such its current approved charter does not specify reclassification criteria However it remains commited to supporting students working above grade level including ELs Since it has a reclassification rate due in great part to its TK student population School leadership added that it believes that like other LAUSD primary centers it is challenging for students in this age group and in the short period of time at PLN Gratts to advance to proficient CELDT levels It further believes it has a similar reclassification rate as other primary centers Nonetheless it has a Title III plan in place to identify students and instruct by ELD levels so that more students can score in the proficient levels based on its revised Master Plan for ELs and its

Report DESEGREGATION IMPACT STATEMENT DIS VALLEY CHARTER MIDDLE SCHOOL BOARD OF EDUCATION REPORT January I Category of Proposed Action The proposed action would renew the charter for Valley Charter Middle School beginning July until June to serve students in grades in each year of the charter term II Summary Description of Current District Practice Charter schools are schools of choice by legislation and are open to any student in the State of California Charter schools are granted single charter status for a maximum of five years It should be noted however that although State legislation allows students to attend a charter school from any area in the state the Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD is under Court Order Crawford v LAUSD which applies to all schools within or chartered through the LAUSD Any modifications to the CourtOrdered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services III Proposed Change The renewal approval of this charter petition would grant the charter of Valley Charter Middle School for five years beginning July until June IV Effects of This Proposal The Los Angeles Unified School District LAUSD does not guarantee availability of Courtordered Integration funding The charter school will be responsible for maintaining the Court Order and providing information requested by the LAUSD as set forth in the Charter petition Modifications or school decisions cannot negatively impact or cause additional costs to the Courtordered Integration budget V Analyze the Impact of This Proposal on Integration Desegregation Resegregation andor Segregation If the Charter goals are met there should be positive results on the five Harms of Racial Isolation which are low academic achievement low selfesteem lack of access to postsecondary opportunities interracial hostility and intolerance and overcrowded conditions The Courtordered Integration Program for participating students will operate under various Court Orders for schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District Any modification of the Courtordered Integration Program must first be approved by Student Integration Services VI If proposed action affects negatively any desegregation program list other options identified If the District Courtordered Integration Guidelines are followed there will not be a negative effect on the Districts

Independent Charter Petitions New and Renewal and Material Revisions DRL DRL is included in all LAUSDapproved charter school petitions Charter School has not had major student discipline issues The school administrator attributes this to his proactive approach to handling student discipline issues Every week the school meets as a whole community to discuss how things are going By talking about prevalent issues many items are resolved before becoming large scale problems The teaching of social and community values has been a cornerstone of these weekly discussions The weekly forums allow teachers to focus on key expectations that are used across the grade levels and throughout the school community to establish the common language that reflects the school values There have been no student expulsions at VCMS since its inception three years ago The focus of these community meetings is on building problem solving and conflict resolution skills Please see table below SUSPENSION and EXPULSION Valley Charter Middle School Suspensions number of incidents Expulsions Based on the most recent school data available as of the date of this report Special Education Similar to District

Galatzan arrived at am OPEN SESSION ITEMS BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTION FOR INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Mr Jefferson Crain announced that the following Resolution will be for action at the Regular Board Meeting of December am Ms Garca Mr Zimmer Uniting Families and Strengthening America Res For Action December Whereas The Los Angeles Unified School District has the responsibility to protect the educational rights of all children and serve those who comply with laws that mandate compulsory education Whereas Our success as a District depends on students that are ready to learn families that encourage learning outside of the classroom educators and support staff with high expectations of success and a community that demands percent graduation Whereas The District embraces all students and families regardless of citizenship on their quest for the American dream Bd of Ed Regular Board Meeting CS Minutes am Whereas Like education citizenship is an important symbol of full membership and participation in society that should be encouraged not barred Whereas When the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program was initiated the District responded to the call with solutions to improve records systems and support for current and former students to obtain their school transcripts Whereas The District launched the Student Enrollment and Placement Assistance SEPA Center to facilitate enrollment and adaptation to newly arriving immigrant students to District schools Whereas Partner organizations have held many DACA informational workshops across the District educating hundreds of students and families that would qualify for the program Whereas Labor community and faith based organizations continue to band together to stand as one to provide these children and their families dignity and justice Whereas Our District family of students parents teachers educators and support staff continue to assist in the dissemination of information and resources for our impacted families and stand ready to assist with President Obamas most recent action Whereas Students should not be punished for their immigration status Instead they should be given recognition for their sacrifice hard work and determination Whereas President Obamas executive action to address this immigration crisis including the expansion of DACA the opportunity for work permits and reducing the likelihood for family separations will benefit many District families Whereas This executive action is a victory for a broad coalition of immigrant rights labor and student activists like our DREAMers across the nation and here in Los Angeles the epicenter of the immigrant rights movement Whereas Our District will be ready once again to help eligible students and their families Whereas Immigration is a federal responsibility and a comprehensive approach to solve our broken immigration system would strengthen our District and the economy of our country and allow aspiring citizens to make an even greater contribution to our communities Whereas The executive action is a step in the right direction and we continue to require a permanent Comprehensive Immigration Reform solution from Congress Whereas We hope to see the day when the children we welcome in the District will be equally embraced in our society and that the lessons we teach in our classrooms about equality inclusion and tolerance no longer contradict the laws that govern our country now therefore be it Bd of Ed Regular Board Meeting CS Minutes am Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District stands in solidarity with President Obamas executive action on immigration reform and encourages subsequent measures that will involve even more families in relief from deportation Resolved further That the Board exhorts Congress to pass a permanent solution to fix our broken immigration system Resolved further That the Board embraces the opportunity to work with the federal government and partner organizations to coordinate and collaborate as it relates to this executive action Resolved further That the Superintendent prepare all options to assist eligible students and their families for President Obamas executive action on immigration when the application and guidelines are released by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Resolved further That the Board requests that the Superintendent work with the Office of Instruction and the Student Involvement Development and Empowerment Unit to develop a plan for engaging high school students to become a volunteer force to assist families and eligible applicants in the information and application process around the executive action and be it finally Resolved That a copy of this resolution be sent to

Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Pursuant to Proposition District staff first engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA District staff evaluated space in the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Several other charter schools also requested space in the same ESC as Charter School The Districts Local Districts have been reorganized into ESCs School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school site that Charter School requested will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year District staff then expanded its search to other schools near to the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located The District determined however that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Therefore District staff recommends providing space to Charter School to accommodate its total indistrict classroom ADA at the Recommended CoLocations Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the necessary elements to counteract the inherent negative effects of poverty and poor academic achievement for lowincome andor students of color Cotton New Small Learning Communities Findings from Recent Literature Portland Ore Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory Jimerson The Hobbit Effect Why Small Works in Public Schools The Rural School and Community Trust August Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report At the middle school level School setasides are used for Personal Learning Environment PLE offices the middle school equivalent to an SLC Likewise School setasides may allocate space for the Districts Response to Intervention RTI program RTI integrates assessment and intervention within a multilevel prevention system to maximize student achievement and to reduce behavior problems With RTI schools identify students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report academic tutorial recreational and enrichment programs Over students in more than schools participate in Beyond the Bell programs on a daily basis See httpbtblausdnetabout Students who participate in after school programs have improved attendance Indeed Beyond the Bells after school programs resulted in improved scores on the EnglishLanguage Arts CST and the Mathematics CST Ibid Such programs are vital to the safety of school children More than million schoolage children have parents who work outside of the home during after school hours Of these million schoolage children million are left to look after themselves when the school day ends Ibid Research shows that juvenile crime sexual activity and experimentation with drugs alcohol and cigarettes peak between the hours of pm to pm Ibid Teens who participate in after school programs are three times less likely to skip classes than teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would require the forcible displacement of a significant number of students attending their local neighborhood school Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Communitycentered schools provide a wealth of benefits for student learning health and safety and for the community at large Many District children walk to and from their neighborhood schools Recent District budgetary cutbacks and the harsh economic climate have made the ability to walk to school a necessity for many families with inDistrict children The District school bus program has realized service cuts and route eliminations which have affected many students As a result of past budget deficits transportation funding was reduced as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial The District school bus program has

came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Walking to school provides an opportunity for purposeful physical activity toward the accumulation of the recommended minutes or more of daily physical activity for children and youth Martin Moeti and PullenSeufert Implementing Safe Routes to School Application for the Socioecological Model and Issues to Consider Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Empirical studies have determined that distance is a key impediment to children walking to school safely Id A recent study published in the Journal of Public Health Policy examines the multilevel correlates of walking to and from school Of the physical environmental factors examined the strongest negative correlates to walking to school were distance and safety concerns Zhu Lee Correlates of Walking to School and Implications for Public Policies Journal of Public Health Policy Recognizing distance as a barrier to the ability for a child to walk to school the CAC and the California Department of Public Health support school siting as well as joint use policies and practices that encourage kids to walk or bike to school See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools prevents children from walking to school or impedes children from taking advantage of safety measures the District has instituted to allow children to safely walk or bicycle to their local neighborhood school At the state level in legislation passed to develop a State Safe Routes to School SRS program In California the SRS program focuses on traffic calming to create walkable communities strengthening the link between injury prevention and physical activity At the national level in the Transportation Reauthorization Bill created the federally assisted Safe Routes to School Program SRTS which provided funding over five fiscal years for states to create SRTS programs The Office of Environmental Health and Safety OEHS has implemented an SRTS program and identified safe pedestrian routes to the vast majority of District schools requested by charters The Pedestrian Routes to School maps provide safe routes and recommended crossings for the attendance area of a District school Below is an example of a pedestrian route map Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an

District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students

capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new

from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students

pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom

be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and

interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No

teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools

Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

The District is making strides in decreasing dropout rates and District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts

school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to

a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic

geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate systems and mentoring programs Research continues to show that small schools and SLCs have the

interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No

teens who do not participate Ibid They are also three times less likely to do drugs consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools

Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of

shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their

school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever

Board of Education Finding that the Charter School Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic

geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or

Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs Bd

Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School

a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and

attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous

security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as

the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular

Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and

and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout rate is high it has been steadily decreasing over the past several years Additionally the Districts Academic Performance Index API scores have been steadily increasing In the District earned an

District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report District students In doing so as expressed above District staff kept in the forefront considerations of student

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

Education Report Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family advocate

students at risk for poor learning outcomes monitor student progress provide evidencebased interventions and adjust the intensity and nature of those interventions depending on a students responsiveness and identify students with learning disabilities or other disabilities In order to provide space to requesting charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The three components of the program include Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education

consume alcohol and engage in sexual activity Ibid To eliminate Beyond the Bell programs would expose the thousands of children who utilize these programs on a daily basis to danger harming their academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety Instructional and Social Implications of a Single Site Offer To accommodate Charter Schools entire indistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial safety concerns for both charter and noncharter District students By way of example District staff estimated that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single campus near to where Charter School wishes to locate would

for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order

required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the

be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance

categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as

setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs

displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California

school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even one nonpromotional school change between the eighth and twelfth grades were twice as likely to not complete high school as students who did not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share

the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities

Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities

room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The

that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District schools As shown by the map depicting gang injunctions in Los Angeles below Los Angeles gangs claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts high school dropout rate for the school year was Although the dropout

District schools are increasing their API scores Displacing District children attending their District school would thwart these efforts Studies have empirically established that disrupting a childs trajectory to its local District high school effectively increases dropout rates A review of years of research conducted by the California Dropout Research Project identified strong predictors of dropping out of high school The compilation study identified nonpromotional school changes student mobility during middle school and high school as a key predictor of a child dropping out of school Rumberger Lim Why Students Drop Out A Review of Years of Research California Dropout Research Project October In the seminal study conducted on the educational consequences of student mobility found a high causal connection between student mobility and an increased risk of high school dropout The staggering results of this study indicate that controlling for other predictors students who made even

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby

Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas

be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Efforts to Minimize the Number of Sites on Which Charter School is Located In order to minimize the number of sites on which a charter school is located for the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool

charter schools District staff have eliminated or reduced the number of School setasides on certain campuses This instructional disruption unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these

otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report projected to

for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict

pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each

funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings

Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned

one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from

Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes

Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular

for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the

Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

the Next Fiscal Year District staff often eliminated setasides at sites in order to make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout high school and autonomous schoolswithinaschool as well as personalization strategies such as student advisories family

Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular

as part of stabilization efforts The latest impact came in July when the District was forced to implement a change to the eligible busing distance for secondary schools from three miles to five miles These cuts disproportionately affect poorer students and make the ability to walk to school even more crucial Not only is the ability to walk to school a necessity for some students but walking to school also provides key health benefits According to the California Active Communities CAC website one in seven of Californias youth is overweight A childs overall health is affected by levels of physical inactivity which can be directly linked to time spent in automobiles versus in active transportation such as walking See wwwcaactivecommunitiesorgschool_sitinghtml Walking to school provides

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from

Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends

safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small groups of students remain together throughout

unfortunately disproportionately affects low income low performing or disabled District neighborhood children those who need assistance the most However District staff has taken these disruptive measures in order to share facilities fairly with charter schools District setasides allocate school space to implement key Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs ensure that all children and youth in the District have access to high quality safe and supervised academic enrichment and recreation programs that inspire learning and achievement beyond the regular school day before and after school and Saturdays The

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from

local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety

instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include structures such as freshman academies multigrade academies organized around career interests or other themes houses in which small

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new

offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order

make room for charter school colocations Setasides are divided into two categories District setasides and School setasides School setasides allocate space for instructional safety and health programs that are specific to a particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and

Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area

Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants

required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from

Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities

particular school For example Title I funding coordinator offices are considered a School setaside Title I funding provides financial assistance to schools with high numbers or high percentages of lowincome children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards The District uses Title I funds to provide additional academic support and learning opportunities to help low achieving children master challenging curricula and meet state standards in core academic subjects Such funds support extra instruction in reading and mathematics as well as special preschool after school and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum Additionally School setasides are used to allocate space for small learning community SLC offices An SLC also referred to as a SchoolWithinASchool is a form of school structure in secondary schools to subdivide large school populations into smaller autonomous groups of students and teachers SLCs include

of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Griffith Joyner Elementary School in Watts also instituted a Walking School Bus program as have others The District spans the territory of more than competing gangs Gang violence is unfortunately prevalent on some campuses and within the neighborhoods of several District

DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools httpwwwnytimescomeducationinchicagocampaigntoprovidesafepassageonway toschoolhtml_r To prepare the routes city employees demolished vacant buildings trimmed Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report trees removed instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights Ibid Despite these improvements and the increased security parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site offers to charter schools would have additional instructional and social ramifications Displaced children would be attending a school that has no relation to their high school attendance area resulting in further disruption of the typical matriculation process It is an indisputable and unfortunate fact that the Districts

not change schools Rumberger Larson Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout American Journal of Education November The safety and welfare of all students is this Districts paramount concern and principal charge The data is indisputable that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in

contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected

Districtwide instructional health and safety programs These setasides include space for District police regional special educational testing centers health center clinics food service and Beyond the Bell programs among others Eliminating these setasides would deny special education students their educational rights or force these students to travel as much as miles to the next closest center The Districtoperated campus health clinics are projected to provide approximately visits to children in the fiscal year who would otherwise have been challenged to access health care and these numbers are projected to increase steadily over the next two upcoming school years To eliminate these clinics would deprive the neediest children of vital health services Additionally Beyond the Bell programs

academic performance and their overall wellbeing Although District and School setasides provide space for programs that are vital to the curriculum of a particular school or to Districtwide goals in order to share space fairly District staff has cut into these setasides where doing so would minimize the number of sites offered to a charter school in order to make a complete offer of space Safety

of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Displacing a significant number of students from their neighborhood school to make room for Charter Schools children would prevent a significant number of children who currently have the ability to safely walk to school from being able to utilize the safe routes to school program Conversely Charter School draws its attendance from many different District schools Therefore providing a single site offer to Charter School would result in endangering a significant number of children currently attending their neighborhood school so that far fewer of Charter Schools students who reside in a particular attendance area would have the ability to walk to school Moreover the forcible displacements would not just be limited to the neighborhood children attending a single District school Instead those students would need to be absorbed into neighboring schools which have insufficient space to house the influx of this number of students and thereby would cause the additional forcible displacement of children from these absorbing schools In effect this would create a ripple effect of forcible displacements necessitating hundreds of neighborhood children to relocate for the benefit of a far lesser number of Charter Schools children Such a decision would pose disproportionate harm to a significant number of children currently attending their local neighborhood school and those District students which would be displaced by the influx of these students and thus produce inequity in the sharing of facilities Not only does distance play a factor in children safely walking to school due to traffic dangers but several Los Angeles neighborhoods are plagued by gang violence In order to create a safe passage to and from school in a neighborhood suffering from gangrelated violence meaningful programs and efforts to mitigate these risks have been launched such as Kid Watch LA which instituted the Walking School Bus at Murchison Street Elementary School near the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights The Walking School Bus enlists parent and community volunteers to accompany groups of small children as they walk to and from school Following this success Florence Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

claim particular territories Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Forcibly displacing students who themselves or whose parents are tied to a particular gang and placing them in a school located in the territory of another gang would potentially breed gang warfare and violence affecting all children teachers staff and parents at a particular school Pulling children out of their neighborhood schools and placing nonneighborhood charter students in those schools prevents the displaced children from taking advantage of safety measures such as the Walking School Bus and therefore unfairly endangers the safety of those displaced children These harms disproportionately affect students attending local District schools As parents of charter school students have elected to send their child to a school out of his or her local attendance area the parents have secured a means of transporting their child to this school However parents of children who attend local District schools may not have the means to find alternate transportation and rely on children walking to their neighborhood school With the aforementioned reduction of several school bus routes and potential further elimination of transportation funding many forcibly displaced children will be forced to walk long unsafe distances or take unsafe public transit routes outside of their neighborhood attendance area The City of Chicago recently closed nearly elementary schools with low attendance rates The result provides a realistic example of what could happen if District children were forced to attend new schools not of their own choosing Like Los Angeles parts of Chicago are plagued by gang violence The school closures have forced many elementary age students to travel through gang territory to reach their new schools In an attempt to make school routes safer the city of Chicago stationed security workers together with police officers a fire truck and a police helicopter along the routes to ensure that students can safely walk by boarded up houses abandoned lots and gang territory to reach their new schools which are often located less than half a mile from their previous schools

parents nevertheless fear for their children who are forced to walk through some of the citys roughest neighborhoods where shootings and other gang violence are regular occurrences often to attend new schools that had long histories of tension and fighting with their former schools Ibid Displacing children attending their District neighborhood schools solely for the purpose of making single site

that children who drop out of school are at far greater risk of a vast array of physical social and economic harm than those who stay in school and complete their secondary education This paramount concern of the District remains a material consideration when weighing whether to forcibly displace hundreds of children from a neighborhood school in order to make way for Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report far fewer students who would attend that school from distant neighborhoods and especially when other solutions for sharing space fairly are feasible An additional impact of such displacement would be the difficulty of sustaining the same level of parental involvement in the absorbing schools located miles away from their neighborhoods that is currently enjoyed by maintaining neighborhood schools California State Board of Education Policy acknowledges that a critical dimension of effective schooling is parental involvement This policy initiative states that research studies demonstrate parental involvement at school propels a childs educational career Forcibly displacing students attending their local neighborhood school would make it more challenging for those children to reap the benefits of parental involvement in their new nonneighborhood schools An alternative to displacing students attending their neighborhood school would be to overcrowd a District campus by adding Charter Schools students However this would cause severe safety and operational ramifications due to the design capacity of the site making this course of action infeasible Adding Charter Schools students to a District campus with insufficient space to feasibly accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA would raise both schools classroom loading ratios thereby disadvantaging both of these schools children Likewise having hundreds of children over a schools capacity sharing space would pose a great risk to student safety and well being In making decisions regarding allocations of space District staff placed the safety of charter school students at the forefront of the decision making process District staff made substantial efforts to locate charter schools at or near their desired geographic location and further made material efforts to minimize the number of sites on which the charter school was located As charter school parents have made a decision to place their child in a school outside of their neighborhood school they must have weighed the safety implications of this decision for their child On the contrary forcibly Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report displaced students families have no place in a decision making process that sends their children to schools outside of their resident neighborhoods Thus forcibly displacing children attending their local neighborhood school would not afford the parents of children attending District schools the same opportunity In addition the decision to forcibly displace students to make way for charter school students necessarily will have safety impacts upon the displaced children whereas given the fact that many charter students already voluntarily travel outside of their neighborhood to attend the charter school these children may not face any increased safety risk by being required to for example travel five miles east instead of five miles south Finally with regard to the number of students affected by these decisions in every case the overall lesser number of students is impacted by the determined course of action Based on the foregoing safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends providing Charter School with a multisite but contiguous offer of facilities at the Recommended Co Locations PROCESS AND MATCHING GUIDELINES DISTRICT STAFF FOLLOWED TO LOCATE SPACE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION The Districts CSD determined that in more than students enrolled in charter schools within the District This figure reflected a more than student increase over the number of students enrolled during the school year In the school year the District had the most charter students attending schools within its boundaries of any school district in the nation It had more than twice as many charter school students as the New York City Department of Education the largest school district in the country The District ensured that every eligible inDistrict charter student was offered a seat For the Proposition cycle the District continues to apply a comprehensive process a process that has resulted in every eligible inDistrict charter school student being offered a Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report seat at a District campus The District follows a critical path schedule of steps from the initial request by a charter school for facilities to making facilities ready for occupancy in order to timely meet the Proposition timeline The District is continuing its Capacity Assessment Roadshow Roadshow in an improved format As it did last year the Roadshow has encompassed school sites in the District and was implemented at the beginning of the Proposition process rather than at the end The District has personnel experienced in school utilization assessing all of the space within the District at the right time Specifically over the course of four weeks retired District principals met with administrators from more than District campuses and identified classroom space used as set asides classroom numbers and locations and classroom size Additionally they identified Special Education programming swing space needed for construction projects Options programming and relocatable classrooms mandated for removal due to Escutia or other legal requirements Moreover this year the Roadshow included information on full school magnets operating Public School Choice schools and new schools The general process District staff followed in administrating City Charters facilities request was the same that it used to process each of the other facilities requests the District received from charter schools for the school year That process is as follows In September and October of SMS staff conducted a comprehensive analysis of the use of District school facilities that is the Roadshow The purpose of the Roadshow was to assess with precision the capacity of each school site in several respects the number of classrooms the manner in which those classrooms are used and the schools operating capacity The Roadshow entailed a detailed investigation of the present use of District school sites and an analysis of the projected future uses of those facilities The analysis included reporting of data by individual schools which was analyzed by SMS staff to confirm its accuracy and to ensure that available space is used efficiently and uniformly throughout the District The Roadshow commenced with a period of inoffice preparation during which SMS staff examined materials submitted by all District schools for accuracy as well as for consistency with Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report previous assessments classroom usage and availability The SMS staff applied standard formulae for the usage of classrooms in order to generate an objective and uniform assessment of the amount of classroom space available at District school sites The purpose of this calculus is to assess the number of classrooms required to accommodate instructional program enrollment based on grade level following the applicable norm tables for studenttoteacher ratios that were formally approved and adopted by the Board of Education as well as specific course subject matters at secondary schools The Roadshow process also involved a series of meetings between school representatives and a person SMS team comprised of former school administrators with extensive familiarity and experience with inDistrict classroom capacity and utilization assessments The SMS team met with the representatives for approximately secondary schools and primary schools During the meetings the participants discussed the submitted documentation enrollment figures and issues related to the school sites classroom utilization needs and usage To ensure that SMS evaluated the data necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of school capacity it analyzed the following documentation for each District school site a current school map the schools current or most recent Norm Day classification report which details the number of students enrolled at that school on September the Norm Day classification report for any magnet center located on the schools campus a completed Classroom Inventory and Allocation Worksheet a District form that identifies a District schools number of classrooms and groups those classrooms into preciselydefined categories according to the specific types of classes for which each classroom is used its square footage and the specific types of equipment and amenities with which it is furnished the number of additional purchased teachers if any from Title andor parent or grant funded and Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report in the case of span schools a breakdown of the number of classrooms used in K and Categorizing classrooms in this way is important because a schools capacity involves more than its raw seats and room numbers The District must determine whether a school has facilities available to sufficiently serve the particular requirements of a school site such as grade levels classes special education programs magnet centers SLCs PLEs legal mandates and other student needs As a result of the foregoing SMS was able to determine specific capacity information regarding District school sites for the school year Utilizing this data SMS provided CSD with the number of estimated available seats as well as classrooms at each campus given specific operating capacities per programmatic and mandated qualifiers When planning for maximal use of available school facilities and in interpreting data generated during the course of facilities planning it is absolutely critical to understand the difference between empty classrooms and available seats To illustrate a hypothetical District school may not have any empty classrooms but may have individual available seats As a result the school may be able to absorb students into its existing classrooms by identifying two free seats spread out among of its classrooms that are used for instruction appropriate to the grade level and subject matter requirements for the students being absorbed Thus it is an entirely different proposition to provide and integrate seats across a campus than to provide six or seven empty classrooms with the same total number of contiguous available seats In many instances there may be many available seats in a school but no empty classrooms This is especially the case for District high schools where the students do not sit in one classroom all day like an elementary school but instead attend at least five or more different classes per day each in different classrooms and with different teachers and groups of students in order to receive the mandated curriculum SMS generated each instructional programs operating capacity using a complex mathematical formula which took into account aspects of schools operations that would reduce operating capacity Each applicable schools operating capacity was modified to also take into account Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report class size reduction requirements set forth in Senate Bill the Quality Education Investment Act of which authorized school districts to apply to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for funds to lower student teacher ratios and class sizes at lower performing schools The District applied for state funds under the provisions of this Act and the District anticipates schools will be approved for funding When a school lowers class size the enrollment capacity of the school is reduced The operating capacity also accounted for classrooms designated as setasides As discussed above set asides are classrooms used for purposes other than general education Public school districts are required to provide one special education room per school They are separately required to provide parent centers at each school and prekindergarten and adult education students are also served in school classrooms across the District District staff analyzed each District schools estimated available seats and classrooms for the school year based on the data provided by SMS Historically the District had prepared to reserve seats at every secondary school and seats at every elementary school for additional unanticipated enrollment As a public institution the District is required to provide an education to every student who chooses to enroll The District previously planned its programming and staffing based on estimated enrollment projections but in the event projections were short the District was still obligated to provide an education to students who were not originally anticipated As a result the District proactively planned to address any potential discrepancies in their projections by reserving seats as an unanticipated growth cushion rather than overcrowd classrooms to the detriment of that education environment as a result of failing to address this common occurrence up front Importantly however beginning two years ago and continuing this year the analysis did not stop there Rather District staff added rigor to this process by examining the actual historical data over the last several years of enrollment at each school site to determine if a trend could be empirically established demonstrating unanticipated growth Based upon this further analysis CSD Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report determined that no seats at any District school sites offered to a charter school should be reserved for an unanticipated growth cushion Therefore this historical reservation of seats was not applied in this cycle The District uses the definition contained in California Code of Regulations title section subdivision a to determine comparison group schools No two schools are identical however on a gradealike basis a significant majority of the Districts schools share reasonably equivalent conditions especially when taking into account age quality of materials and state of maintenance school site size conditions of surfaces as well as mechanical plumbing electrical and firelife systems including conformity to applicable codes availability and condition of technology infrastructure the condition of the facility as a safe learning environment including but not limited to the suitability of lighting noise mitigation and size for intended use the conditions of the facilitys furnishings and equipment and the condition of athletic fields and play area space As part of this process District staff determined whether the conditions of school facilities offered to a charter school were reasonably equivalent to the comparison group schools Matching Guidelines Utilized by the District In accordance with California School Bds Assn v State Bd of Ed CalAppth CSD staff supported and facilitated ESC Instructional Committees to engage in the following process in order to make contiguous offers of space to charter schools in facilities with reasonably equivalent conditions to those which would accommodate the charter students if they otherwise attended District schools District staff makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site or only if necessary on multiple sites in the charter applicants geographic area of interest Consequently District staff first attempts to accommodate charter schools at a single school site and looks for available facilities sufficient to accommodate the entirety of a charter schools projected in District classroom ADA within its desired area of geographic interest Only when no single school site can be feasibly identified based upon school site design and occupancy limitations as well as after taking Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report into account the paramount considerations of both District and charter school student safety and welfare does the District make offers that contemplate the use of multiple school sites District staff first identifies District classroom inventory by grade level configuration in each geographic region Gradealike matches typically provide reasonably equivalent space to charter schools therefore wherever possible District staff allocates space to charter applicants on gradealike school facilities District staff next identifies which charter applicants are already located in District facilities and when feasible matches those charter schools to their existing site District staff then examines and identifies the geographic areas of interest of the charter school applicants As described above often many charter schools request the exact same space so District staff must assess conflicting geographic as well as particular site interests In doing so District staff examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full single site offer Priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved Based on an examination of these criteria District staff makes a preliminary match of available classrooms at a particular site to the projected inDistrict classroom ADA of each charter school District staff attempts to find the most geographically relevant gradealike matches For multi site offers District staff eliminates setasides wherever possible to reduce the number of sites assigned to a charter school which often results in being able to transform multisite offers to single site offers District staff engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating setasides in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and noncharter students in the District For the school year District staff had to grapple with the conflicting needs of all charter school applicants and cycled through the above process as conscientiously as possible shifting space and potential matches to fulfill the Districts obligation to share space fairly among all Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of

Could Not Be Accommodated at a Single Site and Written Statement of Reasons Explaining the Finding Cal Code Regs tit subd Whereas Under Proposition the Los Angeles Unified School District District is required to fairly share space between public school pupils charter and noncharter students alike Whereas In making an allocation of space the District attempts to place a charter school applicant on one school site or when that is not feasible alternatively attempts to minimize the number of school sites on which the charter school applicant is placed Whereas In making an allocation of space the District materially considers the safety implications to charter school students of making a multisite offer and balances the safety instructional and social consequences of displacing children from their neighborhood District schools as well as the burdens associated with such an action on their parents and the community Whereas For the school year charter schools requested facilities under the Proposition process asking for approximately seats from the District Whereas Charter School submitted an application for Proposition facilities for the school year Whereas The Board hereby incorporates the Statement of Facts Regarding Charter Schools Facilities Request and Availability of Space to Meet Charter Schools Facilities Needs contained in the Staff Report on Process for Determining Charter School Cannot be Accommodated at a Single Site Whereas District staff engaged in an effort to create a single site offer to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA Whereas The District cannot accommodate Charter Schools request for a single site at any of the District school sites and or the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate Whereas Several other charter schools also requested space in the same Educational Service Center as Charter School Whereas School Management Services SMS determined that no single District school at which Charter School wished to be located will have sufficient classroom space to accommodate Charter Schools total indistrict classroom ADA in the Next Fiscal Year Bd of Ed Rpt No Page of Board of Education January LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Board of Education Report Whereas District staff then expanded its search to other schools near the geographic area where Charter School wishes to be located but determined that it is not possible to accommodate Charter Schools entire student population on a single site in the Next Fiscal Year Whereas the District cannot accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site Whereas To accommodate Charter Schools entire inDistrict classroom ADA at a single school site would present substantial disproportionate safety concerns for both Charter Schools students and students attending their local District neighborhood school Whereas District staff determined that to house all of Charter Schools students at a single District school site in the geographic area in which Charter School wishes to locate would require the displacement of a significant number of children attending their local neighborhood school whereas far fewer of Charter Schools students would otherwise attend those schools Whereas Displacing children out of their neighborhood schools has farreaching safety instructional and social implications including prohibiting children from safely walking to school subjecting children displaced from their neighborhood school to possible gang violence increasing highschool dropout rates of displaced children and impairing parental involvement in local neighborhood schools Whereas Based on these safety and instructional considerations District staff recommends keeping the student populations of the District schools intact Whereas Alternatively overcrowding a schools campus in order to provide a singlesite offer to Charter School would have equally severe safety and operational ramifications making this course of action infeasible Whereas the District can provide Charter School with a multisite contiguous full offer of reasonably equivalent facilities at the Recommended CoLocations Whereas Providing Charter School space at the Recommended CoLocations minimizes the number of sites assigned to Charter School Whereas Because of the short distance between the Recommended CoLocations they are contiguous facilities in a school district spanning square miles and serving over cities Whereas By providing space to Charter School at the Recommended CoLocations the District has made reasonable efforts to provide Charter School with facilities near to where Charter School wishes to locate Whereas the Board incorporates into these findings the

basis with assistance from District staff POSTPONED TO THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING OF Board Member Resolutions For Action Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in POSTPONED TO THE REGULAR BOARD MEETING OF Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer Mr Kayser Investing Strategically in Expanding PreK Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February ADOPTED AS AMENDED Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating PreK dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee and be it finally Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Ms Ratliff Ms Galatzan Mr Zimmer Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Noticed January am Whereas While students in grades and throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in the Spring Field Test of Math and English Language Arts assessments by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium SBAC students and schools received no results from SBAC from the assessments ADOPTED AS AMENDED BY CONSENT VOTE Whereas Following the Spring SBAC Field Test the District collected testing devices from its school sites is experiencing significant delays in returning the devices to the school sites and has not yet deployed the additional testing devices that the District has determined are required for the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Although thousands of teachers and administrators are working very hard to prepare students for the transition to the new standards for reasons outside of their control students teachers and principals in the District will not have had sufficient time to work with their testing devices and prepare for the mechanics of the new testing medium in advance of the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Unlike the Field Test SBAC is planning to release scores from the Spring SBAC assessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports Whereas However a likely result of the abovementioned lack of preparation with the testing devices and testing medium is that scores on the Spring SBAC assessments in the District may not be indicative of student achievement instructional quality or fidelity to the new Common Core State Standards that the assessments seek to measure Whereas In light of the forgoing it would be patently unfair to use the Spring SBAC assessment results for high stakes accountability purposes with respect to the students teachers Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm and schools of the District and any other school districts in a similar situation and Whereas Superintendent Ramon Cortines has requested that State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the State of California not use the Spring SBAC testing results for any high stakes accountability measures and that any data or scores derived from SBAC testing not have a negative impact on state andor federal funds that are allocated to the students of the District now therefore be it and Whereas The California State Board of Education SBE is scheduled to meet January to discuss Californias SBAC assessments including the reporting of student performance and progress results now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby urges the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California State Board of Education to not use the Spring SBAC assessment results to make any judgments regarding the Districts students teachers or schools and be it finally Resolved That a copy of this resolution and word of its approval be promptly delivered to State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the California State Board of Education in advance of the January SBE meeting and that the appropriate personnel from the Los Angeles Unified School Districts Office of Governmental Relations be directed to timely meet with the aforementioned State officials and advocate for the Boards position including during the January SBE meeting Board Member Resolutions For Initial Announcement Dr McKenna Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Celebration of Black History Month Res Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in US history FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every US president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of Freedom Summer a voter registration project in Mississippi part of a larger effort by civil rights groups such as the Congress on Racial Equality CORE and the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee SNCC to expand black voting in the South Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of The Civil Rights Act of the nations benchmark civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin Passage of the Act ended the application of Jim Crow laws in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be separate but equal was constitutional Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters and Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the theme to be A Century of Black Life History and Culture now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black American History Month Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all of the people of the United States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to us by Black culture and be it be finally Resolved That the Superintendent will work with educators librarians and all the schools of the District and the community to recognize and celebrate this month with appropriate programs ceremonies and activities that generate indepth discussions of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans Dr Vladovic Ms Galatzan National No One Eats Alone Day Res Whereas Social isolation is a problem that affects far too many youth in our middle schools FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas Social isolation can all too often be a precursor to teasing bullying and even violence to oneself and others Whereas Beyond Differences was established in to create an end to social isolation by changing the culture of middle school Whereas Beyond Differences is dedicated to the proposition that all students should feel included valued and accepted by their peers Whereas Beyond Differences has had a tremendous impact because it is a teenled social movement which emphasizes peer to peer training and schoolbased activities Whereas wwwnooneeatsaloneorg is being used as a web tool to sign up schools to encourage their participation Whereas Beyond Differences Teen Board has been leading middle school assembly programs for four years and has presented to nearly students and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Whereas Beyond Differences is leading National No One Eats Alone Day Spread the Love on February now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of Los Angeles Unified School District joins Beyond Differences in proclaiming February National No One Eats Alone Day and encourages all middle schools to join in this effort and hold a No One Eats Alone on their campus Mr Zimmer Dr Vladovic Support of Compliance with Fair Labor Practices for Agricultural Vendors Res Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has learned that Gerawan Farming has had contracts with the District and is currently under consideration for further contracts FOR ACTION FEBRUARY Whereas In Gerawan Farming workers invoked a California law allowing neutral state appointed mediators to decide union contracts when employers refuse to sign them and in late the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board ALRB ordered that the threeyear contract was to take immediate effect Whereas Since workers requested the state mediator the ALRB general counsel has filed five complaintstantamount to indictmentsaccusing Gerawan Farming of illegally excluding some of its farm workers from the benefits of a [union contract] illegally instigating and encouraging the gathering of signatures on petitions to decertify the UFW unlawfully interrogating workers about their union activities and surveilling workers failing to bargain in good faith with its employees union intimidating [employees] in the exercise of their right to participate in negotiations and failing to implement the stateissued union contract Whereas Gerawan Farmings refusal to implement the contract means its roughly employees have not been paid many millions of dollars they are owed by Gerawan Farming from July to July and many millions of dollars more over the contracts duration now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District calls upon Gerawan Farming to comply with state and federal laws including labor relations anti discrimination and minimum wage and hour laws and to immediately implement the agreement issued by the neutral mediator and the State of California Resolved further That the Board ensures that agricultural vendors and suppliers be in compliance with all local state and federal laws including the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and be it finally Resolved That the Procurement Services Division report back to the Board updating Gerawan Farmings compliance with fair labor practices before any contracts with this vendor are brought to the Board for approval Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Stamped Order of Business pm Resolution Requested by the Superintendent

MDA provides an objective and easily readable analysis of the Districts financial activities on both a short and longterm basis This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MDA and should be read in conjunction with it The Districts MDA can be found immediately following the report of the independent auditors Profile of the Los Angeles Unified School District The District encompasses approximately square miles in the western section of Los Angeles County The District is located in and includes virtually all of the City of Los Angeles and all or significant portions of the cities of Bell Carson Commerce Cudahy Gardena Hawthorne Huntington Park Lomita Maywood Rancho Palos Verdes San Fernando South Gate Vernon and West Hollywood in addition to considerable unincorporated territories devoted to homes and industry The District was formed in as the Common Schools for the City of Los Angeles and became a unified school district in i As of June the District is operating elementary schools middlejunior high schools senior high schools options schools multi level schools special education schools magnet schools and magnet centers community adult schools regional occupational centers skills centers regional occupational program center early education centers infant centers and primary school centers The District is governed by a sevenmember Board of Education elected by district to serve alternating fouryear terms As of June the District employed certificated classified and unclassified employees Enrollment as of September was students in K schools students in adult schools and centers and children in early education centers As a reporting entity the District is accountable for all activities related to public education in most of the western section of Los Angeles County This report includes all funds of the District with the exception of the fiscally independent charter schools which are required to submit their own individual audited financial statements and the Auxiliary Services Trust Fund which is not significant in relation to District operations The Auxiliary Services Trust Fund was established in to receive and disburse funds for insurance premiums on student body activities and property all city athletic and musical events grants restricted for student activities and other miscellaneous activities Economic Condition and Outlook Below is a table to show unemployment rates for both the nation and the state of California For the month of October states that have significantly higher unemployment rates than the nation include Georgia at Mississippi at Rhode Island at and California at Californias October unemployment rate is the lowest since July Month January February March April May June July August September October US California P P Preliminary estimate Source Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey Nationwide the unemployment rate has improved from to from October to October States with the highest statistically significant change over this period are Illinois at Nevada at and Colorado at Californias yearoveryear change is from in October to in October in unemployment rate Californias economy has accelerated this year and is expected to its current momentum next year The forecast is that more jobs will be created in the US this year than in any year since dropping the unemployment rate to a year low According to UCLA Anderson Forecast the drought in California will have a marginal overall impact on agriculture in the State But School Services of California noted that the loss of average daily attendance that may result from the drought in communities that are hit by the loss of workers who leave the area due to a lack of work was not addressed However State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson ii announced that he will use his administrative authority to maintain school funding levels for districts impacted by the drought Noticeable uptick in the housing market the stock market and the labor market are signs of improving national and state economies The Legislative Analysts Office LAO forecasts a stronger California economy for than what was projected by the Department of Finance during the May Revision Budget which means a higher revenue forecast compared to the State Budget Act estimate for LAO predicts that all of the remaining K apportionment deferrals may terminate after fiscal year There may even be a partial pay down of the remaining state mandates backlog and Emergency Repair Program and additional funding for Common Core State Standards or the California Career Pathways Trust LAO also forecasted that the Local Control Funding Formula LCFF target entitlement may not be fully funded at the end of the eightyear implementation period as planned by the governor but several years thereafter The LAO forecast extends to which includes the years when the Proposition temporary increased taxes will expire The increase in sales tax rates will end in while the income tax increase on highincome earners will end in Although the expiration of these temporary taxes will reduce Proposition and directly impact support to education the total change in education funding would depend on the States economic climate before during and after the years when Proposition expires Superintendents Strategic Plan The Los Angeles Unified School District has developed five Key Strategies These strategies refer to the set of common sense approaches we will use to support the instructional core to help every LAUSD student achieve their maximum potential Transform teaching and learning so that we prepare all youth to graduate college and be workforce ready Ensure there is an effective employee at every level of the organization focused on improving student outcomes Provide a portfolio of high quality schools for all youth families and communities Ensure a safe caring and nurturing environment for all youth Operate an effective efficient and transparent organization in order to assure the public trust Financial Information The District maintains internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use and disposition and to provide reliable records for preparing financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes the importance of a close evaluation of costs and benefits which requires estimates and judgments by management The objective is to establish effective internal controls the cost of which should not exceed the benefits derived therefrom We believe that the Districts internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of proper recording of financial transactions School districts in California are required by Education Code Section to follow the California School Accounting Manual in preparing reports to the State The District in accordance with Board election on October utilizes a singleadoption budget schedule that requires Final Budget iii adoption by the Statemandated July deadline The District is allowed to modify its adopted budget within days of the passage of the State budget Education Code Section EC mandates that a school districts expenditures may not legally exceed budgeted appropriations by major object classification namely certificated salaries classified salaries employee benefits books and supplies services and other operating expenditures capital outlay other outgo and other financing uses EC further specifies that districts may not spend more than the amounts authorized in the Final Budget as adjusted during the fiscal year Encumbrance accounting to ensure effective budgetary control and accountability Unencumbered appropriations lapse at year end and encumbrances outstanding at that time are reported as assigned fund balance for subsequent year expenditures is utilized Financial Results In the Statement of Changes in Net Position shows that the Districts Net Position decreased by million during the year This includes a million restatement of beginning balance to reflect the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as a result of adopting Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities The Unrestricted Net Position which is negative declined from million to million The negative Unrestricted Net Position is largely the result of the Districts retiree health benefit liability OPEB liability The liability reflected which represents the previous years liability increased by the current years unfunded expense is million an increase of million from The latest actuarial report estimates the net present value of the entire year liability to be billion The District started to prefund its OPEB liability through an irrevocable Trust However the contribution made to the Trust is not enough to offset any existing or increase in the OPEB liability Hence it is projected that the Districts Total Liabilities will eventually exceed its Total Assets In the fund balance of the General Fund increased by million from million to million This increase is primarily due to higher apportionment received from Local Control Funding Formula sources brought about by the new revenue apportionment calculation Audit Results The District received an Unmodified financial audit An unmodified or clean opinion is issued when the auditor can state without reservation that the financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP For the federal compliance audit programs received an Unmodified audit and programs were Qualified The District received an Unmodified state compliance audit There were audit findings in The amount of the questioned costs declined from million in to million in Even with these improvements the District will continue to work with schools and offices to focus on resolving the remaining areas of internal control and compliance issues Awards The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada GFOA awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to Los Angeles Unified School District for its comprehensive annual financial report for the fiscal year ended June In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized comprehensive annual financial report This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements iv A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only We believe that our current comprehensive annual financial report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Programs requirements and we are submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate Acknowledgments We wish to express our appreciation to the Division of Accounting and Disbursements team the various District divisions who assisted

auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the provisions of California Code of Regulations CCR Title Education Section et seq Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgment including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error In making those risk assessments the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Districts preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control Accordingly we express no such opinion An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial

statements Such information although not a part of the basic financial statements is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational economic or historical context We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with managements responses to our inquiries the basic financial statements and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements We do not

tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws regulations contracts and grant agreements and other matters The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Districts internal control over financial reporting and compliance Los Angeles California December LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June As management of the Los Angeles Unified School District we offer readers of the Districts financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal which can be found on pages iv of this report Financial Highlights The assets of the District exceeded its liabilities at the close of the most recent fiscal year by billion net position This amount is net of a billion deficit in unrestricted net position resulting primarily from the cumulative increase in unfunded liabilities for other postemployment benefits OPEB The Districts total net position decreased by million from prior year total primarily due to lower operating grants and contributions received As of the close of the fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of million from June At the end of the current fiscal year committed assigned and unassigned fund balances for the General Fund including reserve for economic uncertainties was million or of total General Fund expenditures The Districts total longterm obligations increased by million during the current fiscal year The increase resulted primarily from additional net OPEB obligation offset by the decrease in certificate of participation and general obligation bonds payable resulting from payment of matured debts and refunding Overview of the Basic Financial Statements This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Districts basic financial statements The Districts basic financial statements comprise three components governmentwide financial statements fund financial statements and notes to basic financial statements This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves Governmentwide financial statements The governmentwide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the Districts finances in a manner similar to a privatesector business The statement of net position presents information on all of the Districts assets deferred outflows of resources liabilities and deferred inflows of resources with the difference between these elements as net position Over time increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating The statement of activities presents information showing how the Districts net position changed during the most recent fiscal year All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs regardless of the timing of related cash flows Thus revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Each of the governmentwide financial statements relates to functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues governmental activities The governmental activities of the District are all related to public education The governmentwide financial statements can be found on pages of this report Fund financial statements A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives The District like other state and local governments uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with financerelated legal requirements All of the funds of the District can be divided into three categories governmental funds proprietary funds and fiduciary funds Governmental funds Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements However unlike the governmentwide financial statements governmental fund financial statements focus on nearterm inflows and outflows of spendable resources as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year Such information may be useful in evaluating a governments nearterm financing requirements Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the governmentwide financial statements it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements By doing so readers may better understand the longterm impact of the Districts nearterm financing decisions Both the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities The District maintains individual governmental funds In the governmental funds balance sheet and in the governmental funds statement of revenues expenditures and changes in fund balances separate columns are presented for General Fund District Bonds Fund County School Facilities Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund and all other funds Individual account data for all other nonmajor governmental funds are provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this report The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the General Fund to demonstrate compliance with the budget The governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages and of this report Proprietary funds The District maintains Internal Service Funds as the only type of proprietary fund Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the Districts various functions The District uses internal service funds to account for Health and Welfare Benefits Workers Compensation SelfInsurance and Liability SelfInsurance Because all of these services benefit governmental functions they have been included within governmental activities in the governmentwide financial statements It is the Districts practice to record estimated claim liabilities at the present value of the claims in conformity with the accrual basis of accounting for all its internal service funds The proprietary fund financial statements can be found on pages of this report Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Fiduciary funds Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the governmentwide financial statements because the resources of those funds are not available to support the Districts own programs The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds The fiduciary fund financial statements can be found on page of this report Notes to basic financial statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the governmentwide and fund financial statements The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages of this report Combining and individual fund schedules and statements Combining schedules and statements consisting of the budget to actual comparisons for District Bonds Fund County School Facilities Fund Bond Interest and Redemption Fund the individual accounts within the nonmajor governmental funds the internal service funds and the fiduciary funds are presented immediately following the required supplementary information Combining and individual fund schedules and statements can be found on pages of this report Governmentwide Financial Analysis As noted earlier net position over time may serve as a useful indicator of a governments financial position In the case of the District assets plus deferred outflow of resources exceeded liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources by billion at the close of the most recent year By far the largest portion of the Districts net position billion reflects its investments in capital assets eg land buildings and equipment less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding The District uses these capital assets to provide services to students consequently these assets are not available for future spending Although the Districts investments in its capital assets are reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities The Districts restricted net position billion represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used The majority of this pertains to Federally Funded Programs The remaining negative balance in unrestricted net position billion resulted primarily from the recognition of billion of net OPEB obligation At the end of the fiscal year the District is able to report positive balances in all categories of net position except for unrestricted net position The million increase in capital assets net primarily relates to the continuing school construction and modernization projects throughout the District Longterm liabilities increased by million primarily due to additional net OPEB obligation offset by the decrease in certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable as a result of debt service payments and debt refunding to avail of lower interest rates Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Summary Statements of Net Position in thousands As of June and In the District adopted GASB Statement No which requires the restatement of the June net position in Governmental Activities The result is a decrease in net position at July of million See further discussion in Note p on pages of this report Continued As RestatedCurrent Assets Capital

Continued LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June Financial Analysis of the Governmental Funds As noted earlier the District uses fund accounting to facilitate compliance with financerelated requirements Governmental funds The focus of the Districts governmental funds is to provide information on nearterm inflows outflows and balances of spendable resources Such information is useful in assessing the Districts financing requirements Committed assigned and unassigned balances comprise the unrestricted fund balances and may serve as a useful measure of the Districts net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year As of the end of the current fiscal year the Districts governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of billion a decrease of million in comparison with the prior year Approximately million of this total combined ending fund balance constitutes unrestricted fund balance which is available for spending at the Districts discretion The remaining are either restricted or nonspendable and are not available for new spending restricted balances billion nonspendable inventories and revolving cash million The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District At the end of the fiscal year the unrestricted fund balance of the General Fund was million while the total fund balance is million As a measure of the General Funds liquidity it may be useful to compare both the unrestricted fund balance and the total fund balance to the total fund expenditures The unrestricted fund balance represents of the total General Fund expenditures while the total fund balance represents of that same amount The fund balance of the Districts General Fund increased by million during the current fiscal year This is primarily due to higher apportionment received from Local Control Funding Formula sources brought about by the new revenue apportionment calculation Other changes in fund balances in the governmental funds are detailed as follows in thousands The fund balance decreased during the current year for the District Bonds due to continued spending for school construction modernization projects and renovation and for the Bond Interest Redemption Fund primarily from lower property taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bond issues plus a decrease in federal subsidy for the payment of interest On the other hand County School Facilities Bonds increased primarily due to fewer projects in progress causing a lower expenditure level Special Revenue increased primarily due to lower operating deficit from Adult Education Other Capital Projects increased primarily due to very minimal spending Continued CountySchoolBondOtherDistrictFacilitiesInterest andSpecialDebt CapitalBondsBondsRedemptionRevenueServiceProjectsTotalFund Balance June Nonspendable Restricted Committed Assigned Total Fund Balance July Increase decrease in fund balance Other Governmental Funds LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Managements Discussion and Analysis June of project funds combined with project cost transfers to other capital project accounts Debt Service has a very slight movement in the account This is primarily due to the offsetting effect of debt service payments and revenues derived from operating transfers from user funds and investment income Proprietary funds The Districts proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the governmentwide financial statements At the end of the year the Districts proprietary funds have unrestricted net position of million The net increase of million in the current year is primarily attributed to the increase in net position of the Health and Welfare fund as a result of slightly higher investment income and Medicare Part D subsidy that offsets its operating loss General Fund Budgetary Highlights Los Angeles Unified School District closely monitors and reviews its revenue and expenditure data to ensure that a sufficient ending balance is maintained This monitoring and review occurs from the development of the budgeted data through the Statemandated first and second interim financial reports and at year end utilizing the actual revenue and expenditure data Modified Final Budget vs Original Final Budget The Districts Original Final Budget is based on assumptions from the States May Revision Budget while the Modified Final Budget is based not only on the States May Revision Budget but also on all other known State budgetary changes and changes to the Districts priority of program implementations andor planned expenditures Differences between the General Fund Original Final Budget adopted by the Board of Education in June and the Modified Final Budget resulted in a lower budgeted ending balance by million from million to million Adjustments to the Original Final Budget were a decrease in beginning balance by million a decrease in budgeted revenues by million an increase in other financing sources by million and an increase in budgeted expenditures and other financing uses by million The decrease in beginning balance by million was to reflect the actual ending balance as of June as opposed to the estimated June ending balance The net decrease in budgeted revenues and other financing sources of million was mainly due to reduced estimated Other State revenues from grants The estimated expenditures and other financing uses remained at about the same level with a variance of only million Actual vs Modified Final Budget The beginning balance remained the same on both the actual and the Modified Final Budget The unfavorable variance of million in revenues and other financing sources between the actual and Modified Final Budget was primarily due to multiyear grants budgeted in their entirety but earned only to the extent of actual expenditures incurred The favorable variance of million in expenditures and other financing uses between the actual and the Modified Final Budget was due to lower than anticipated expenditures across all major objects of expenditures The largest decreases in expenditures were mainly in Certificated Salaries million

June The Districts total longterm obligations increased by million during the current fiscal year The key factor in this increase was the recognition of additional net OPEB obligation and increase in legal cost accrual offset by the decrease in certificate of participations and general obligation bonds payable resulting from payment of matured debts LongTerm Credit Ratings Moodys Investor Service Moodys and Standard and Poors SP currently rate the Districts General Obligation Bonds and Certificates of Participation COPs The District requested withdrawal of all Fitch ratings in September The Districts current underlying ratings on its general obligation bonds are Aaand AA from Moodys and SP respectively The Districts COPs are currently rated A and A by Moodys and SP respectively The District purchased municipal bond insurance andor reserve surety bond policies at the time of issuance for some of its COPs and bonds Moodys SP and Fitch assigned insured ratings of Aaa AAA and AAA respectively on said COPs and bonds at the time of issuance Subsequent to February the rating agencies downgraded the ratings of certain bond insurers including all of those who had issued bond insurance policies andor surety bonds on District issues State statutes limit the issuance of general obligation bond debt by a unified school district if the outstanding general obligation bonds are more than of its total taxable property The debt limitation for the District as of June is billion which is in excess of the Districts outstanding general obligation bond debt after reflecting assets available in the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund for payment of principal Additional information on the Districts longterm obligations can be found in Notes and on pages of this report Impact of Upcoming Standard Effective for FY the District will adopt Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions This statement changes accounting and financial reporting by state and local government for pensions One of the major changes in financial reporting is that state and local governments are now required to recognize net pension liability

unfunded liability in the pension plan The amount will be determined and disclosed in next years CAFR reporting Requests for Information This financial report is designed to provide a general overview

However in the statement of activities the cost of those assets is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense Some of the capital assets acquired this year were financed with capital leases The amount financed is reported in the governmental funds as a source of financing On the other hand the proceeds are not revenues in the statement of activities but rather constitute

The District is primarily responsible for all activities related to K public education in most of the western section of Los Angeles County State of California The governing authority as designated by the State Legislature consists of seven elected officials who together constitute the Board of Education Board Those organizations functions and activities component units for which the Board has accountability comprise the Districts reporting entity The Districts Comprehensive Annual Financial Report includes all funds of the District and its component units with the exception of the fiscally independent charter schools which are required to submit audited financial statements individually to the State and the Auxiliary Services Trust Fund which is not significant in relation to District operations This fund was established in to receive and disburse funds for insurance premiums on student body activities and property all city athletic and musical events and grants restricted for

finances The governmentwide financial statements which are the statement of net position and the statement of activities report information on all nonfiduciary District funds excluding the effect of interfund activities Governmental activities which are normally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues are reported separately from businesstype activities which are primarily supported by fees and service charges The District does not conduct any businesstype activities The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function Program revenues include charges to customers or applicants who purchase use or directly

cash flows The agency funds report only assets and liabilities and therefore have no measurement focus Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting Revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual ie both measurable and available to finance expenditures of the fiscal period Available means collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay current liabilities Application of the susceptibility to accrual criteria requires consideration of the materiality of the item in question and due regard for the practicality of accrual as well as consistency in application Federal revenues and State apportionments and allowances are determined to be available and measurable when entitlement occurs or related eligible expenditures are incurred Secured and unsecured property taxes related to debt service and community redevelopment purposes that are estimated to be collectible and receivable within days of the current period are recorded as revenue Investment income is accrued when earned All other revenues are not considered susceptible to accrual Continued

Protection Account EPA LCFF sources are the basic financial support for District activities The Districts LCFF is received from a combination of local property taxes EPA and state apportionments For the fiscal year the District received million of local property taxes million of EPA and million of State aid Implementation of the LCFF began in with a projected eightyear transition period For school districts and charter schools the LCFF creates base supplemental and concentration grants in place of most previously existing K funding streams including revenue limits and most state categorical programs Until full implementation local educational agencies LEAs will receive roughly the same amount of funding they received in plus an additional amount each year to bridge the gap between current funding levels and the new LCFF target levels Funding is calculated based on data reported by each LEA including pupil attendance local revenue and other demographic factors in accordance with the LCFF Allocations are made through the Principal Apportionment system The county is responsible for assessing collecting and apportioning property taxes Taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property in the county The levy is based on the assessed values as of the preceding March which is also the lien date Property taxes on the secured roll are due on November and February and taxes become delinquent after December and April respectively Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due on the lien date March and become delinquent if unpaid by August Secured property taxes are recorded as revenue when apportioned in the fiscal year of the levy The county apportions secured property tax revenue in accordance with the alternate method of distributions prescribed by Section of the California Revenue and Taxation Code This alternate method provides for crediting each applicable fund with its total secured taxes upon completion of the

temporary tax increases is deposited into the EPA which is used to support increased school funding The California Department of Education reduces the Districts entitlement by the Districts local property tax revenue and EPA entitlement The balance is paid from the State General Fund and is known as the State Apportionment As a result a receivable has not been recorded for the related property taxes in the General Fund as any receivable is offset by a payable on the state apportionment o Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses in the accompanying basic financial statements Actual results may differ from those estimates p New Accounting Pronouncements The GASB has issued Statement No Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities effective for period beginning after

reported as assets and liabilities and recognizes as outflows of resources or inflows of resources certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities In the District adopted GASB Statement No which requires the restatement of the June net position in Governmental Activities by the amount of the unamortized bond issuance costs as these costs are now required to be recognized as

ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Notes to Basic Financial Statements Year Ended June Nonspendable fund balances represent amounts that cannot be spent either because they are in nonspendable form or because they are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact Restricted fund balances represent amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes because of constitutional provisions or enabling legislation or because of constraints that are externally imposed by creditors grantors contributors or the laws or regulations of other governments Committed fund balances represent amounts that can be used only for specific purposes determined by a formal action of the governing board through the adoption of a resolution The governing board is the highest level of decisionmaking authority for the District These committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless the governing board removes or changes the specific use through formal action Governing board action to commit fund balance needs to occur within the fiscal reporting period no later than June The amount which will be committed can be determined subsequently but prior to the release of the Districts

Districts adopted policy delegates the authority to assign amounts for specific purposes to the Superintendent or designated executive committee Unassigned fund balances represent all other spendable amounts When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance is available the District considers restricted funds to have been spent first When an expenditure is incurred for which amounts in any of the unrestricted classifications of fund balance could be used the District considers committed amounts to be reduced first followed by assigned amounts and then unassigned amounts Minimum Fund Balance Policy As part of the Budget and Finance Policy the governing board has adopted a minimum fund balance policy for the General Fund in order to avoid the need for service level reductions in the event that an economic downturn causes revenues to be substantially lower than budgeted The policy requires the District to maintain an economic uncertainty reserve consisting of unassigned amounts equal to at least of total General Fund operating expenditures In the event that the District must expend all or part of this reserve the District will identify and implement a budgetary plan to replenish this reserve the following year This reserve may be increased based on legal requirement The policy also requires the Total General Fund balance to be maintained at a minimum level of of Total General Fund expenditures and net transfers out In the event that the General Fund balance falls below this level all onetime monies are to be setaside until the threshold is met in addition to other recommendations that may be developed Contingencies a General The District as well as current and former Board Members and employees to whom

outcome of such lawsuits will not have a material effect on the Districts financial condition b Grants The District has received state and federal funds for specific purposes that are subject to

internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above In planning and performing our audit of compliance we considered the Districts internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with OMB Circular A but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance Accordingly we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control over compliance Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified However as discussed below we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses and significant deficiencies A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over compliance such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items F F F and F to be material weaknesses A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item F to be a significant deficiency The Districts responses to the internal control over

California Department of Education will determine the impact of the above exceptions on the After School Education and Safety Program funding if there is any LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs June Recommendation We recommend that the District strengthen its procedures on attendance documentation for the After School Education and Safety program The District should ensure that the agencies performing the services for these programs are aware of the district policies specifically on maintaining accurate attendance records We also recommend for the District to continue performing agency visits to make sure that the established policies are complied with Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions Beyond The Bell Branch agrees with the finding Consequently we will continue to implement the following procedures to ensure that we are providing training on attendance reporting policies and procedures as well as how we are monitoring how the procedures are being implemented at the sites to ensure documentation of reported attendance figures is readily available and accurate for auditing purposes Agency contractors and program personnel are required to attend a StartUp Meeting scheduled prior to the beginning of the school year During the StartUp Meeting extensive time is spent on training staff on the importance of properly documenting and maintaining accurate attendance Beyond the Bell Branch Administrators and Traveling Supervisors attend the training meeting and interject their role in monitoring attendance procedures as they travel to sites Beyond the Bell staff routinely monitors attendance to ensure procedures are being used and documentation is maintained as required Contractors and agency program personnel are required to attend an annual Policies and ProceduresRisk Management training As a result of previous audit findings and reflection on best practices Beyond the Bell developed an attendance documentation training that was implemented during the year Currently the training is offered on a monthly basis Newly hired personnel must register for and attend the next available training date Returning personnel must register for and attend the training during the fiscal year The following Policies and ProceduresRisk Management training dates are scheduled for the year NOTE Attendance Documentation has been implemented as a result of previous audit findings Contractors and agency program personnel are invited to attend a Federal Program Monitoring FPM training The FPM training reflects the CDEs Program Dimensions The goal of this training is to offer personnel a best practices approach to running exemplary programs that comply with the requirements in the Education

students served and reported to the California Department of Education by the District Beyond the Bell Branch contracted with CitySpan Technologies Incorporated A nationally recognized service firm which specializes in administering online attendance monitoring programs to administer an online attendance reporting and monitoring system Beyond the Bell Branch through our needs assessments and evaluations recognized the need to strengthen our internal controls to ensure attendance data is compiled and reported accurately Furthermore Beyond the Bell Branch recognizes the need to maintain sufficient documentation for the reconciliation between the Districts Quarterly Attendance Reports QAR and information submitted to the California Department of Education Consequently Beyond the Bells gathering of attendance data and reporting procedures has evolved As a result of the current and previous audit findings the following system and procedures have been implemented Monitoring has been strengthened from quarterly to monthly and all contractors and staff are now required to submit attendance documentation monthly which has resulted in more accurate attendance reporting to the CDE Beyond the Bell issues a current Alpha Roster containing student identification numbers to agencies Prior to this practice agencies were responsible for obtaining student identification numbers from schools Frequently the information was outdated or incomplete Beyond the Bell continues the process of reviewing agencys SigninSignout Rosters to ensure required information is recorded on a daily basis Upon review of agency documents LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs June Beyond the Bell Branch will develop an attendance documentation training scheduled for implementation for the year Agencies submit their attendance electronically through a secured website to CitySpan Technologies Incorporated A discrepancy report is issued to agencies requesting them to make corrections of errors when they are identified Agencies correct and resubmit the reports and discrepancies are fixed in attendance reports The reporting of attendance to the California Department of Education CDE is accomplished online biannually through ASSIST through close collaboration with CDEs technical staff to ensure accurate transfer of the information As a result of the volume generated by Beyond the Bell programs the CDE has approved the submission of attendance through an EXCEL program via email Personnel at CDE then upload the data into ASSIST Once the data is in the system the Beyond the Bell designee approves the data submitted We will continue to monitor these changes in protocol to ensure that the procedures are followed and all information is reported accurately and documented as necessary for auditing purposes Should problems arise in any area for contractors or staff Beyond the Bell will alter and refine the process accordingly to ensure

eligibility Of the students tested students were selected for verification of their English Language Acquisition Status ELAS designation of English Learner EL in accordance with procedure a of the audit guide The ELAS designations include English Learner EL English Only EO Reclassified Fluent English Proficient RFEP or Initially English Proficient Student IFEP Students who are determined to be EL can be reclassified based on completion of required measures Reclassification is the process by which the District determines if students who are EL have acquired sufficient proficiency in English to perform successfully in core academic subjects without English Language Development ELD support Successful reclassification would lead to the students ELAS designation changing to either RFEP or IFEP Based on our testing we noted that four students from four schools were incorrectly reported in CALPADS as EL as of the census date October One student was reclassified by the school prior to the census date but the District did not change the designation until after the census date As a result this student was incorrectly reported as EL and should be excluded from the Districts Unduplicated Pupil Count UPC For one student the school was unable to provide the supporting documentation for the EL designation According to the schools official the California English Language Development Test CELDT was not returned by the state vendor Thus a hand score had to be performed by the school However the Student Score Sheet was not retained As a result we are unable to verify the students EL designation For two students multiple records were keyed into the CALPADS to enter the student initial EL designation subsequent reclassification of the EL designation and other demographic data Due to CALPADS functionality the subsequent changes to the EL designation inputted into CALPADS were override by the original entry of EL As a result two students were incorrectly reported as EL and

Los Angeles California Members of the Board In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the Los Angeles Unified School District District as of and for the year ended June in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America we considered the Districts internal control over financial reporting internal control as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control Accordingly we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Districts internal control A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entitys financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified Given these limitations during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses However material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified We did identify certain deficiencies in internal control described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs that we consider to be significant deficiencies as items FS through FS Although not considered to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses we also noted certain items during our audit which we would like to bring to your attention These comments are summarized in the following report to management on pages to Our observations and recommendations have been discussed with appropriate members of management and are intended to strengthen internal

the Disaster Recovery Business Continuity Program plans and they are expected to be completed by May The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments ML Construction in Progress and Transfers to Depreciable Capital Assets Observation Since the District has undertaken numerous construction projects to either repair or modernize existing school facilities and starting in to build new schools Facilities Program Support Services a branch within the Districts Facilities Services Division FSD facilitates the proper accumulation and recording of the costs related to construction projects The Information Technology Division ITD and Integrated Library and Textbook Support Services ILTSS facilitate proper accumulation and recording of the costs related to School Network Modernization Projects and Library Renovation Programs respectively ITD also is responsible for all internally developed software used by the District Construction in progress CIP is a District general ledger account that refers to the temporary classification of capital assets that are being builtassembleddeveloped before being placed in service The District tracks all its costs related to the buildingassemblydevelopment of such assets until the asset is completed The Districts formal policy for the determination of when an FSD project is completed is the Notice of Completion NOC which is filed with the Los Angeles County RegistrarRecorder Office For ITD School Network Modernization Projects the Test and Acceptance Form is the determination of completion Internally developed software is moved to completed projects when substantially completed and put in service For ILTSS projects the Budget Modification Form issued to close the project is the determination of completion During our testing of the costs accumulated in CIP and transfers to depreciable capital assets we noted that certain Facilities construction ITD and ILTSS projects amounting to million million and million respectively were completed during fiscal year but were still in CIP We also noted that trailing charges related to certain depreciable capital assets in the amount of million that remained in CIP have not been transferred to depreciable capital assets Depreciation expenses related to these completed projects amounted to million for fiscal year and million for prior fiscal years In addition we noted that certain projects with cumulative costs of million were completed in prior years but were transferred and recorded to depreciable capital assets during fiscal year The related deprecation expenses that should have been reported in prior years amounted to million Impact During fiscal year the District has established new and improved policies and procedures and conducted training for the analysis and reconciliation of the CIP accounts In its continuous effort to clean up the CIP accounts misclassification of construction in progress and depreciable capital assets were discovered that resulted in audit adjustments in depreciation expenses for fiscal year Recommendation We recommend that the FSD ITD and ILTSS departments dedicate sufficient staff resources to perform timely analysis and review of the CIP accounts The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments Management Response Management notes that there have been significant improvements in accounting for construction in progress and transfers to depreciable capital assets The District will continue the improvements by ongoing update of policies and procedures as needed providing basic and advanced training at least once a year and identifying issues and providing oversight to the settlement process and linking asset records to projects in the accounting system of record SAP ML Procurement of Construction Contracts Observation During our review of the internal controls over the Districts procurement procedures related to construction contracts we noted that a total of three out of procured construction contract samples were missing the Public Works Contracts PWC form Public works refers to construction projects that are paid for in whole or in part out of public funds The PWC form should be completed by the awarding body and submitted through the California Department of Industrial Relations DIR online access The completion and the submission of this form fulfills the required public works project award notification to both the Division of Apprenticeship Standards [Labor Code sec replacing former DAS notification and the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement Public Works Compliance Monitoring Unit [ Cal Code Reg sec a] The District in their effort to retrieve the PWC from the DIRs website was unable to access their prior submissions As a result the District was unable to support their preparation and submission of the PWC Impact Failure to submit the PWC to the DIR would result in noncompliance with the respective labor code Recommendation The District should adhere to the reporting requirements set forth by the DIR and retain supporting documentation of the submission Management Response Management concurs The Construction Contracts team will work to resolve issues with online access and submission of the online PWC forms In the interim Facilities Contracts will submit paper PWC forms to ensure compliance with this requirement The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments ML Procurement of Professional Services Observation Our review over the internal controls of the Districts procurement procedures related to Professional Services revealed a total of three task order contracts with procured vendors in which the District did not obtain a Due Diligence investigation andor background check in a timely manner Based on the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts revised in April The District will perform due diligence investigation andor background check of any Architectural Engineering AE or Professional Services firm planning to enter into a contract agreement with the District The thresholds and timing requirements for when the Due Diligence reports are to be requested are as follows For any one contract over million in value or multiple contracts for a single firm with a potential cumulative value of over million Facilities Contracts will request OIG to perform a Due Diligence Investigation The District may delay due diligence investigations for task order contracts until the cumulative assigned task orders approach the required limits This investigation will take approximately weeks to prepare and Facilities Contracts may use the results of this audit for up to two years after its completion The total cumulative value of assigned task orders for all three vendors procured reached the million threshold during Fiscal Year As of June the District has not requested the OIG to perform a Due Diligence Investigation for two of the three vendors procured upon the cumulative assigned task order reaching the required limit For one of the three vendors procured the District relied on a prior Due Diligence Investigation which was performed beyond the allowable two year window as per the requirement Impact Untimely review of procured vendors Due Diligence Investigation will delay the Districts response to potential issues which may arise from the investigation As it states in the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts upon review of the Due Diligence Investigation if there are any serious issues which are uncovered the Director of Facilities Contracts or his designee will conduct a responsibility hearing with the firm to validatediscard the issues raised If the responsibility hearing proves the firm is nonresponsible the Facilities Contracts will not issue any additional task orders to that firm until the contract expires Recommendation The District should adhere to the Districts DeskTop Procedures for Facilities Contracts and perform Due Diligence Investigations based on the requirements The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Current Year Management Letter Comments Management Response Management concurs Controls will be implemented to ensure that Task Order contracts that have reached in total contract value will have a Due Diligence performed to ensure that potential issues are addressed in a timely manner Management will review all task order contracts that have reached the threshold to ensure that Due Diligence reports are requested and reviewed by April The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Lack of Sufficient Authorization for SAP Program Changes Recommendation SAP Transport Request

not implemented See FS of the Section II Findings Relating to the Basic Financial Statements which are Required to be Reported in Accordance with GAS ML SAP Maintain Payroll Position Descriptions Access Recommendation ITD management should periodically review access to the maintain payroll position descriptions PO transaction code and remove inappropriate access in a timely manner Current Status Corrective actions implemented Access removed ML Access To Mainframe System Parameter Datasets SYS Recommendation ITD management should periodically review access to SYS datasets that control the IFS environment and remove inappropriate access in a timely manner Current Status IFS was replaced as of July Accordingly no further actions are required ML IFS Production Dataset Access Recommendation ITD management should periodically review access to IFS production data and remove inappropriate access in a timely manner The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments Current Status IFS was replaced as of July Accordingly no further actions are required ML Welligent Change Control Recommendation ITD management should implement program change control procedures that include documenting business sponsor ITD and user acceptance approval Current Status Corrective actions implemented Change control procedures have been documented ML Ineffective Accrual Procedures for ConstructionRelated Payments Recommendation The District should implement a systematic methodology or procedure to be used in determining what expenditures need to be recorded as accrued liabilities in the appropriate fiscal year especially for departments that involve high volume of expenditure transactions For constructionrelated expenditures where typically actual billings by vendors take place at a much later date from when the services are rendered project managers and other employees responsible for overseeing delivery of goods and services from third party vendors should be made responsible and held accountable to coordinate with FSD ITD and Accounts Payable Department in determining ongoing projects for which services have been rendered but have not been billed at yearend Alternatively these same project managersemployees may be assigned the responsibility to coordinate with third party vendors to encourage timely submission of billingsinvoices Actual billingsinvoices can then be the basis for the amount of expenditures to be accrued at yearend Current Status Corrective actionss implemented Facilities and ITD have made significant improvements to their procedures for accruing constructionrelated payments These improvements include better coordination between staff and vendors implementation of threewaymatch in the SAP accounting system recording of expense at GR posting and changes in accounting for retention These improvements substantially reduced missed construction accruals down to immaterial amounts in fiscal year The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Analysis of Accounts Receivable Overpayments Recommendation We recommend that the District continue implementing procedures to develop and maintain an organized subsidiary ledger of Accounts Receivable employee overpayments where overpayments and corresponding collections of these overpayments by employee are accounted for In that way the District has a better basis of determining the overpayments impact in the fund financial statements Current Status Corrective actionss implemented The District has developed and maintained subsidiary ledgers that detail the overpayment receivable by employee The Payroll Administrations management is in the process of implementing new wage types to track all overpayments and unrecoverable amounts The new wage types will post to the subsidiary ledgers and have information that reflects at the employee level the overpayments and corresponding collections made to the overpayments This will also serve to improve the process currently applied by the Districts management to assess the collectability of overpayments which are used to estimate the reserve for bad debts ML Construction in Progress and Transfers to Depreciable Capital Assets Recommendation We continue to recommend that the FSD perform a more thorough analysis of costs incurred for New Construction Existing Facilities and Library Services projects when deciding whether these projects are completed and are ready to be put into operation and therefore are to be depreciated Specifically the District should establish and implement a clearer policy that addresses proper identification of completed projects Currently FSDs trigger point in determining a projects completion is a notice of completion document for the projects primary construction contractors Supposedly this document denotes that a project is completed or substantially completed This information has to be verified by the facilities group and communicated to the General Accounting Branch Same for ITD projects ITD should thoroughly analyze all existing projects and evaluate each projects completion The results of the evaluation should be communicated as well to the General Accounting Branch for proper recording of the assets completion Current Status Corrective actions not implemented See ML of the Current Year Management Letter Comments The Honorable Board of Education Los Angeles Unified School District December Status of Prior Year Management Letter Comments ML Data Center Physical Access Recommendation Data Center access reports should be reviewed and signed periodically eg every to months by ITD management to identify and remove inappropriate physical access to the data center Current Status Corrective actions implemented Data Center access has been reviewed and documented ML IT Asset

REPORT NO Los Angeles Trust for Childrens Health MOU Revision Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR ACTION Ms Ratliff Ms Galatzan Mr Zimmer Request to Delay Use of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Assessments for High Stakes Purposes for the School Year Res Whereas While students in grades and throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District participated in the Spring Field Test of Math and English Language Arts assessments by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium SBAC students and schools received no results from SBAC from the assessments Whereas Following the Spring SBAC Field Test the District collected testing devices from its school sites is experiencing significant delays in returning the devices to the school sites and has not yet deployed the additional testing devices that the District has determined are required for the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Although thousands of teachers and administrators are working very hard to prepare students for the transition to the new standards for reasons outside of their control students teachers and principals in the District will not have had sufficient time to work with their testing devices and prepare for the mechanics of the new testing medium in advance of the Spring SBAC assessments Whereas Unlike the Field Test SBAC is planning to release scores from the Spring SBAC assessments to parents teachers students and schools the release of which the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports Whereas However a likely result of the above mentioned lack of preparation with the testing devices and testing medium is that scores on the Spring SBAC assessments in the District may not be indicative of student achievement instructional quality or fidelity to the new Common Core State Standards that the assessments seek to measure Whereas In light of the forgoing it would be patently unfair to use the Spring SBAC assessment results for high stakes accountability purposes with respect to the students teachers and schools of the District and any other school districts in a similar situation and Whereas Superintendent Ramon Cortines has requested that State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the State of California not use the Spring SBAC testing results for any high stakes accountability measures and that any data or scores derived from SBAC testing not have a negative impact on state andor federal funds that are allocated to the students of the District now therefore be it and Whereas The California State Board of Education SBE is scheduled to meet January to discuss Californias SBAC assessments including the reporting of student performance and progress results now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District hereby urges the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the California State Board of Education to not use the Spring SBAC assessment results to make any judgments regarding the Districts students teachers or schools and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That a copy of this resolution and word of its approval be promptly delivered to State Superintendent of Public Instruction Torlakson and the California State Board of Education in advance of the January SBE meeting and that the appropriate personnel from the Los Angeles Unified School Districts Office of Governmental Relations be directed to timely meet with the aforementioned State officials and advocate for the Boards position

Mr Bryan Ramirez Perez Student This report was postponed to the Regular Board meeting of February BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR ACTION The following resolution was postponed to the Regular Board meeting of February Mr Zimmer Ms Ratliff Resolution to Close the Commercial Property Loophole Res Noticed October and Postponed from Previous Meetings Whereas Voters in the state of California approved Proposition in Whereas Proposition created limits on the property taxes paid by residential and commercial properties Whereas Residential and commercial property values in California are reassessed upon change of ownership Whereas On average California residential property changes hands every years while change of ownership for commercial property is far more complicated and therefore generates reassessments less often Whereas Commercial property owners are able to avoid reassessment of their property by limiting the portion of ownership that changes hands to ensure that no single party owns more than percent Whereas Property taxes represent the single largest source of funding for public schools Whereas Proposition resulted in a percent drop in property tax collections and through subsequent legislation the State assumed a greater role in funding of schools Whereas Since the State of California has assumed a greater role in the funding of public schools perpupil support has declined from the top in the nation to the bottom Whereas Proposition is anticompetitive in that new entrepreneurs and businesses must pay fair market value for their property while commercial property owners who have owned their property for a longer time pay disproportionately lower property tax rates Whereas Californias schools enroll the largest share of English learners ELs in the US and has a larger percentage of students from lowincome families than does the rest of the US Whereas Research shows that ELs and students from lowincome families cost more to educate Whereas California spends far less per student than do states such as Illinois and New York that have smaller percentages of both ELs and economically disadvantaged students Whereas Among states California ranks st in the number of students per teacher st in the Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm number of students per guidance counselor st in the number of students per librarian and th nationally in the number of students per administrator Whereas Public schools in California face challenges in providing an equitable and fair education for a student population with vast differences in language poverty parental education level and other social educational and economic factors and Whereas Regularly reassessing nonresidential property would according to an analysis of data provided by the California Board of Equalization generate at least billion in additional revenue for public schools and other public services now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District supports efforts to modify how the value of commercial properties in California are reassessed to allow for more regular and fair commercial property value reassessment while maintaining Proposition protections for residential properties and small businesses Resolved further That tax revenues generated by modernizing how commercial property is reassessed benefit local schools and essential social services and be it finally Resolved That the Los Angeles Unified School District supports this effort and will communicate this position to local elected officials including members of the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors the Los Angeles City Council as well as Senators and Assembly members Mr Zimmer moved the following resolution Investing Strategically in Expanding K Dual Language Instructional Pathways Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on February Whereas This resolution called for the creation of a committee tasked with identifying the resources needed to grow enrollment in dual language programs Whereas The committee produced a report detailing recommendations and investments needed to address the goals of the resolution Whereas District staff has made significant progress addressing the recommendations in the report including many related to investing in and operationalizing diverse recruiting strategies developing comprehensive professional development plans for teachers in dual language programs determining and funding the use of external assessment instruments for less commonly taught languages and developing comprehensive outreach and retention strategies now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District directs the Superintendent to prepare a strategic investment plan to address the short mid and longterm goals of creating K dual immersion instructional pathways in the District as per the recommendations of the committee and be it finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Board requests the Superintendent report back on this plan by the March meeting of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Mr Kayser seconded the motion Superintendent Cortines responded to questions from Board Members regarding budget allocations and plans for expansion of duallanguage programs Remarks were heard from Board Members With the consent of the resolutions mover and seconder an amendment to change all occurrences of K to PreK was accepted as friendly After discussion and by general consent the resolution was adopted as amended Ms Garca was absent Later in the meeting Ms Garca recorded an aye vote on the resolution The final version of the resolution is as follows Mr Zimmer Mr Kayser Investing Strategically in Expanding PreK Dual Language Instructional Pathways Res Noticed December Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District approved the resolution Commitment to Prepare Students for a Multilingual Global Economy on

of the Board or the March meeting of the Curriculum Instruction and Assessment committee Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm BOARD MEMBER RESOLUTIONS FOR INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT The following resolutions will be for action at the Regular Board meeting of February Dr McKenna Ms Garca Ms Ratliff Celebration of Black History Month Res Whereas Black History Month or National African American History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in US history Whereas Carter G Woodson a Harvardtrained historian like WEB Du Bois before him believed that truth would not be denied and that reason would prevail over prejudice and as a result announced Negro History Week in to raise the awareness of the contributions of African Americans Whereas Since the commemoration was extended from a weeklong event to the entire month of February Whereas Every US president has officially designated the month of February as Black History Month and other countries around the world including Canada and the United Kingdom also devote a month to celebrating Black history Whereas Over the past century Black American life history and culture have become major influences throughout America in music art literature politics athletics education and diplomacy and has become appreciated by the global community Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of Freedom Summer a voter registration project in Mississippi part of a larger effort by civil rights groups such as the Congress on Racial Equality CORE and the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee SNCC to expand black voting in the South Whereas Last year marked the th anniversary of The Civil Rights Act of the nations benchmark civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin Passage of the Act ended the application of Jim Crow laws in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be separate but equal was constitutional Whereas The respect that fellow citizens have for one another determines the values of our country and reinforces the premise that Black life matters and Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes the theme to be A Century of Black Life History and Culture now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District recognizes February as National Black American History Month Resolved further That the Board acknowledges that all of the people of the United States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to us by Black culture and be it be finally Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm Resolved That the Superintendent will work with educators librarians and all the schools of the District and the community to recognize and celebrate this month with appropriate programs ceremonies and activities that generate indepth discussions of the complex factual history of the United States and the legacy of Black Americans Dr Vladovic Ms Galatzan National No One Eats Alone Day Res Whereas Social isolation is a problem that affects far too many youth in our middle schools Whereas Social isolation can all too often be a precursor to teasing bullying and even violence to oneself and others Whereas Beyond Differences was established in to create an end to social isolation by changing the culture of middle school Whereas Beyond Differences is dedicated to the proposition that all students should feel included valued and accepted by their peers Whereas Beyond Differences has had a tremendous impact because it is a teenled social movement which emphasizes peer to peer training and schoolbased activities Whereas wwwnooneeatsaloneorg is being used as a web tool to sign up schools to encourage their participation Whereas Beyond Differences Teen Board has been leading middle school assembly programs for four years and has presented to nearly students and Whereas Beyond Differences is leading National No One Eats Alone Day Spread the Love on February now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of Los Angeles Unified School District joins Beyond Differences in proclaiming February National No One Eats Alone Day and encourages all middle schools to join in this effort and hold a No One Eats Alone on their campus Mr Zimmer Dr Vladovic Support of Compliance with Fair Labor Practices for Agricultural Vendors Res Whereas The Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District has learned that Gerawan Farming has had contracts with the District and is currently under consideration for further contracts Whereas In Gerawan Farming workers invoked a California law allowing neutral state appointed mediators to decide union contracts when employers refuse to sign them and in late the State Agricultural Labor Relations Board ALRB ordered that the threeyear contract was to take immediate effect Whereas Since workers requested the state mediator the ALRB general counsel has filed five complaintstantamount to indictmentsaccusing Gerawan Farming of illegally excluding some of its farm workers from the benefits of a [union contract] illegally instigating and Bd of Ed Regular Meeting Minutes pm encouraging the gathering of signatures on petitions to decertify the UFW unlawfully interrogating workers about their union activities and surveilling workers failing to bargain in good faith with its employees union intimidating [employees] in the exercise of their right to participate in negotiations and failing to implement the stateissued union contract Whereas Gerawan Farmings refusal to implement the contract means its roughly employees have not been paid many millions of dollars they are owed by Gerawan Farming from July to July and many millions of dollars more over the contracts duration now therefore be it Resolved That the Governing Board of the Los Angeles Unified School District calls upon Gerawan Farming to comply with state and federal laws including labor relations anti discrimination and minimum wage and hour laws and to immediately implement the agreement issued by the neutral mediator and the State of California Resolved further That the Board ensures that agricultural vendors and suppliers be in compliance with all local state and federal laws including the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and be it finally Resolved That the Procurement Services Division report back to the Board updating Gerawan Farmings compliance with fair labor practices before any contracts with this vendor are brought to the Board for approval MISCELLANEIOUS BUSINESS SPECIAL REPORTS The Board is in receipt of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report Mr Crain made the following statement Ed
