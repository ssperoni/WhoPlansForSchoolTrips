graduated from the th grade in whereas when young people drop out of high school there is no system in place to find those students identify why they dropped out and connect them to the supports they need to succeed in school and work whereas high school dropouts earn less than of all dollars earned in the us and in the nations largest cities they make less per year than high school graduates whereas s hr the reengaging americans in serious education by uniting programs act raiseup act offers a strategy to close these gaps and challenges every high school dropout to attain a high school diploma a postsecondary credential and a family supporting career whereas the raiseup act would provide billion in new federal funding to integrate existing often disparate services into an

young people in disadvantaged situations that left secondary school without a high school diploma including runaway and homeless youth youth in foster care and those aging out of care and young people

plus per week for years because he believed that to bring about real change for poor people he and his family had to live as poor as the farm workers whereas cesar e chavez changed the attitudes of the workers in the fields and the nation far beyond by leading them to live the la causa slogan s se puede by empowering all to fight for civil rights and to strive for justice for all minorities whereas cesar e chavez espoused the education of the heart for all students because he believed that it is not enough to teach our young people to be successful to seek achievement and to make

ensuring that each and every child experiences the type of early environment at home at child care at school and in the community that will promote early learning whereas highquality early childhood services represent a worthy commitment to our childrens future by providing them with both practical skills and broader intellectual abilities whereas the los angeles unified school district serves more than children from birth to five years of age in a variety of early care and education programs whereas the district is a national leader in providing services to young children whereas in

facilities currently available whereas licensed programs are only available for of children with parents in the labor force whereas postsecondary students in california struggle with transfers between educational institutions who wish to attain the early childhood education degree whereas a lack of consistency in colleges and confusing educational requirements result in duplication of coursework content whereas continued frustration can lead students away from the field of early childhood education whereas efficiently sending students through postsecondary education to attain the early childhood education baccalaureate minimizes unnecessary usage of higher education resources whereas providing highquality early learning particularly for those children most in need is a proven return on investment and must be viewed as part of the solution for improving our educational system and bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas improved articulation and transfer pathways for obtaining early childhood education degrees would benefit both the student and the state now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district supports senate bill

education report no this item was withdrawn prior to the meeting board member resolutions for action mr zimmer moved the following resolution supporting s hr to ensure all students attain a high school diploma whereas the los angeles unified school district is committed to ensuring that children educated in the district have the opportunity to receive a quality education that earns them a meaningful high school diploma and that they are college prepared and career ready whereas in the competitive environment of the st century it is essential for individuals in los angeles to have a high school diploma in order to obtain a living wage whereas the governing board of the los angeles unified school district believes that it is unacceptable that only of districts high school students graduated from the th grade in whereas when young people drop out of high school there is no system in place to find those students identify why they dropped out and connect them to the supports they need to succeed in school and work whereas high school dropouts earn less than of all dollars earned in the us and in the nations largest cities they make less per year than high school graduates whereas s hr the reengaging americans in serious education by uniting programs act raiseup act offers a strategy to close these gaps and challenges every high school dropout to attain a high school diploma a postsecondary credential and a family supporting career whereas the raiseup act would provide billion in new federal funding to integrate existing often disparate services into an intentional dropout recovery system at the local level where services that focus on education job training and wraparound support services would be provided and whereas the raiseup act would serve young people in disadvantaged situations that left secondary school without a high school diploma including runaway and homeless youth youth in foster care and those aging out of care and young people

ensuring that every student has the opportunity to graduate from high school prepared to attend college or embark on a successful career whereas the resources available to support public education in california are insufficient to fulfill this critical obligation whereas due to deep cuts to state funding the district is faced with a million budget deficit this year on top of an million reduction last year whereas in an effort to absorb these cataclysmic cuts the district was forced to reduce its instructional school calendar by days increase class sizes in the early grades and dramatically reduce school support services including nurses librarians library aides gardeners and custodians whereas local revenue generation and local control of our schools should be available to school districts as an emergency method of managing fiscal crises whereas a recent public policy institute of california ppic survey found that approximately eight in ten residents believe that funding decisions for public schools should be made locally whereas california voters approved parcel taxes in elections between and whereas percent received a majority vote but not the necessary twothirds vote required for approval whereas approximately percent of parcel tax attempts would have been successful under a threshold and whereas our communities should have the ability to increase local revenues to better serve our students now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the education of the city of los angeles supports the efforts of the californians for improved school funding to place the local control of local classrooms funding act on the state ballot on november the measure that would bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm amend the state constitution by lowering the threshold of votes required to pass a school parcel tax from twothirds to percent and be it further resolved that the board instructs the superintendent and the office of government relations to

to expand it from a week to a month long celebration and in may the month of may was permanently designated as asianpacific american heritage month whereas understanding asian pacific islander history is an important part of celebrating asian american and pacific islander heritage month whereas asian americans and pacific islanders have contributed in significant ways to all aspects of society whereas asian americans and pacific islanders have endured and overcome hardship and heartache in the earliest years tens of thousands of gold rush pioneers coal miners transcontinental railroad builders as well as farm and orchard laborers were subject to unjust working conditions prejudice and discrimination yet they excelled whereas even in the darkness of the exclusion act and japanese internment asian americans and pacific islanders have persevered providing for their families and creating opportunities for their children and whereas in the district of the student population are identified as asian filipino or pacific islander now therefore be it bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm resolved that the board of education of the city of los angeles proclaims may as the asian

first generation that will have a shorter life expectancy than their parents in the absence of nutrition intervention whereas a number of studies have found that greater consumption of sugarsweetened beverages is associated with overweight and obesity among both adults and children whereas in in an effort to curb the consumption of sugarsweetened beverages among all students k the governing board of the los angeles unified school district passed the motion to promote healthy beverage sales whereas in in an effort to address childhood obesity sb and later sb were signed into law thus restricting the sale of sweetened beverages at elementary middle and high schools during the school day whereas existing law permits the sale of electrolyte replacement beverages sports drinks that contain no more than grams of added sweetener per ounce serving whereas sb would restrict the sale of sports drinks in k schools and whereas effective july sport drinks shall not be sold to a student

adopted senate bill support our law enforcement and safe neighborhoods act legislation that gives local arizona law enforcement officials who are not trained in federal immigration law substantial responsibility for enforcing immigration laws whereas sb contains a number of unconstitutional provisions including a provision that local law enforcement may arrest individuals solely because they believe there is probable cause that the individual is undocumented and is unable to provide documentation of his or her status whereas sb does not prohibit law enforcement officers from relying on race ethnicity national origin or language to determine whom to investigate whereas this legislation effectively sanctions and promotes unconstitutional racial profiling and harassment and blatantly violates the civil rights of both arizona residents and all visitors to the state whereas the lausd seeks to provide a well rounded and quality education that exposes students to cultures that are crucial to understanding our nation past and present and that helps our students to appreciate the histories and cultural contributions of their own communities whereas the lausd offers a variety of ethnic studies courses within our curriculum with the objective of preparing our students to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures to the tapestry of our civilization and whereas the state of arizona recently adopted house bill legislation which prohibits public schools from teaching ethnic studies a ban that further reinforces the intolerant discriminatory and racist philosophy embodied by sb now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district expresses its outrage and condemnation of sb and hb and calls on the leadership of the state of arizona to reverse these punitive and misguided measures bd of ed special meeting minutes pm resolved further that the board urges lausd students and their families to be aware of arizonas policies violating visitors civil rights if traveling to the area resolved further that the board directs the superintendent to make recommendations regarding additional steps that should be taken to curtail any economic support to the state of arizona in the form of districtsponsored employee travel or lausd contracts with firms based in the state and be

critical thinking skills adding to overall academic achievement school success and preparation for the work world whereas art classes provide students a chance to develop cognitive and creative skills and to develop their imagination whereas californias investment in the arts and arts education ranks th out of states as the california arts councils budget for providing grants to place arts teachers into residence schools and providing arts programming into rural and underserved areas has fallen nearly over the last years from million in to million in whereas senate bill would open the door for additional funding for arts and arts education without touching the general fund whereas senate bill would enable taxpayers to voluntarily donate amounts in excess of their tax liability to the

senate appropriations committee directly to the floor now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district hereby declares its support for senate bill which

ms martinez seconded the motion which by general consent was adopted ms flores was absent ms martinez moved a waiver of board rule regarding the resolution in support of california jobs budget mr zimmer seconded the motion which by general consent was adopted ms flores was absent mr zimmer moved the following whereas the los angeles unified school district is responsible for providing every student with an excellent education that prepares him or her for success in college or career whereas devastating state budget cuts have severely undermined the districts capacity to meet this responsibility lausd will absorb over billion in budget cuts over the past two years including a million reduction in the budget and an million reduction in the budget whereas the lausd pays its bills almost entirely with money from the state as california runs out of money because of the economic crisis the state gives less money to lausd whereas californias publics schools ranked near the bottom among the states and district of columbia in perstudent funding whereas these reductions cut into the very fabric of the public education system and have already forced lausd to increase class sizes shorten the school year by at least five days halve the awardwinning arts and music program and lay off critically needed social workers school nurses counselors and secondary teachers whereas lausd has also eliminated unnecessary bureaucracy reducing the central office budget by and the local district offices by since whereas the employees of the lausd have made very difficult sacrifices to share in the solution to this budget crisis accepting furlough days and pay reductions whereas assembly speaker john a prez has introduced the california jobs budget a new proposal to solve californias budget deficit while creating private sector jobs and preventing economically harmful cuts to schools public safety and the states safety net whereas the california jobs budget is the product of over budget subcommittee hearings full budget committee hearings and seven budget forums held throughout the state whereas the california jobs budget closes the states billion general fund shortfall and ends the year with a billion final reserve whereas the centerpiece of the california jobs budget is a billion jobs and economic stability fund that will protect against the loss of private sector local community and school jobs in the governors may budget revision and which will also generate tens of thousands of new jobs bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas this budgetary proposal rejects the governors slashing of safety net programs which would actually cost the state more and instead maintains welfare to work childcare and cost effective alternatives to expensive nursing homes whereas it also rejects billion of the governors devastating cuts to education and instead meets the proposition guarantee and puts a stop to the endless cuts to k and higher education in order to protect californias future and whereas the california jobs budget protects education by generating additional revenues through a new oil severance tax and the delayed implementation of corporate tax loopholes that were created in previous budget solutions now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district declares its support for the california jobs budget and directs the superintendent of schools to transmit this resolution to the members of the los angeles delegation and the governor of the state of california ms
