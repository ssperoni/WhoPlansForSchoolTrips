discussion we the governing board of the los angeles unified school district stand united in our belief that our most important role is to set policies that ensure every student graduates college and career ready regardless of race ethnicity primary language circumstances of poverty gender or any other factor that may impact our youth and their families we know research tells us and the experiences of the students of lausd demonstrate that the clearest pathway to this goal is through our ability to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn from an effective teacher in a school led by an effective leader and supported by the highest caliber team of adults working on behalf of their success every day that is why we empanelled the teacher effectiveness task force which consisted of all our key stakeholders this work began in april and set the course for a thoughtful and deliberate process to reach excellence for all our students the taskforce provided us with a set of recommendations based on the best available research and resources the experience of the taskforce members and their knowledge of the critical steps needed to move us forward as a system although we may disagree in the manner in which the local media released test scores linked to individual teachers we share the urgency with the multitudes who have voiced qualified support of a more professional and datainformed culture of teacher and leader performance reviews we also firmly believe that the ultimate determination of an individual teacher or administrators level of effectiveness must be comprised through thoughtfully using multiple measures of performance including such measures as observation from welltrained professionals contributions to the school community stakeholder feedback in a form such as surveys and measures of student achievement over time not a single point in time among others and as important is the fact that this process be developed with teachers and administrators and not done to teachers and administrators that is why we are asking the superintendent to expedite negotiations with united teachers los angeles and associated administrators of los angeles to develop a fair and valid process by which we can employ multiple measure reviews that differentiate between performance levels of our educators allowing us to better target our support interventions and resources and offering the opportunity to better leverage the amazing teachers and leaders throughout lausd that are too often unrecognized and unsung in this effort we have issued a set of principles that make clear our expectation from staff as they begin negotiations in earnest these principles are from our core beliefs surrounding this work and as such must be fully embraced this board will accept nothing less the principles are as follows evaluations must include multiple measures including a balanced use of appropriate valueadded data evaluations must differentiate levels of instruction and performance including actual good instructionleadership evaluations must place strong provision on evidence of student learning over time offering feedback to instruction rather than feedback to simple routines evaluations must mean something to the employee ratings must always be useful to teachers and administrators we must offer specific feedback on any level of performance bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whether excellent or poor performance and use it as part of a professional conversation in an ongoing manner through the year not just at one time at the end of the year evaluation rating must be considered for use in all employment decisions including new hires or when restructuring a school finally this board makes it clear that we celebrate and support every one of our employees the recent results of cst scores suggest that our employees are working harder than ever and are fully committed to the academic success of students we will not rest until we reach success for all our students by having an effective teacher in every classroom and an effective administrator in every school mr david holmquist general counsel stated that if the board feels the statement is reflective of its beliefs the statement would be considered a statement of intent to direct staff to formulate a sunshine proposal to the utla after discussion president garca announced that a special meeting will be held on september to adopt the discussed statement president garca resumed the order of business consent items items for action below were assigned by the

meeting june pm special board meeting june am annual board meeting july am special closed session july am special closed session july ms martinez moved that the consent items be adopted mr zimmer seconded the motion which by general consent was adopted bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm board member resolution for initial announcement ms flores withdrew the resolution supporting early chronic school absence prevention whereas it is the goal of the los angeles unified school district lausd to increase student attendance and decrease student dropouts thereby increasing student achievement and graduation rates whereas chronic absenteeism defined as a student missing or more of school due to both excused and unexcused absences results in lost instructional time and contributes to lower student achievement starting in kindergarten and puts students at greater risk of dropping out of school in future years whereas nationwide one out of ten kindergarteners and st graders are chronically absent and as many as a quarter of all krd graders are often being similarly affected whereas in the lausd there are currently elementary schools and more than students who are missing in excess of or more school days which can impact their learning and significantly contributes to lower inseat attendance rates whereas while chronic absence rates are higher and more intractable in secondary schools it is crucial to start addressing the problem among our youngest students before they fall behind academically and poor attendance habits become entrenched whereas analyzing schoollevel attendance data is crucial in determining patterns of chronic absenteeism which can then be addressed with more impactful programmatic responses whereas lausd recognizes that parents play a critical role in student attendance and is creating a parent engagement plan in which parents are educated on the importance of good school attendance for their children whereas lausd has a reduced and limited number of centrallyfunded pupil services and attendance counselors psa due to budget cuts and thus schools and schoolbased counselors alike will have reduced support from district offices for the upcoming school year whereas a variety of tools exist or are being developed that can help identify problematic attendance and improve attendance rates these include mydata in which a trigger can be developed to notify both parents and teachers when a child is academically atrisk due to chronic absences isis in which a portal is being developed to allow parents access to information regarding their childs homework attendance and academic records and connected which allows for communication between schools students and families whereas schools can reduce chronic absenteeism through sitebased strategies such as creating school attendance data teams that could include pupil services and attendance counselors to track chronic absenteeism patterns utilizing rti to target early interventions offering attendance incentives encouraging families to support their students coming to school and creating emergency back up plans reaching out to chronically absent students and their families and identifying barriers to attendance connecting families to resources such as after school preschool bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm and health programs that can address barriers to attendance and incorporating strategies to improve attendance in the attendance and dropout prevention plan whereas lausd has an existing intervention program to address truancy and absences and while important it misses an opportunity to address chronic attendance problems due to excused absences and prior to children falling behind academically whereas the education of all children can be adversely affected when teachers divert attention to meet the needs of chronically absent children and help them catch up due to lost instructional time whereas lausd loses more than million in average daily attendance ada revenue annually due to student absences in addition to the unquantifiable loss in student learning and whereas by addressing chronic absenteeism in lausd instructional time for all students can be strengthened and ada can increase which would augment resources available to all students now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of los angeles unified school district directs the superintendent to provide an analysis within days of chronic absenteeism patterns at schools categorized by school grade and student population and to use the data to work toward reducing the chronic absenteeism rate to no more than in any school by the end of the school year resolved further that the superintendent create a pilot program for sixteen elementary schools two per local district as identified by ld superintendents and based on absenteeism rates that would begin in the spring semester and run through the end of the school year with the specific goal of reducing each schools chronic absentee rate by at least from their rate specifically each elementary school in the pilot program will create a student attendance team the director of pupil services will utilize available pupil services and attendance counselors to assist the student attendance teams in reviewing chronic absence data by grade classroom and neighborhood of residence and identifying barriers to attendance in the school community based upon the analysis of their own attendance data each school will develop a numeric target and plan for reducing chronic absenteeism utilizing evidencebased techniques and programs the established school plan will be incorporated into each attendance and dropout prevention plan at the end of the district will reassess its goals for chronic absentee reduction given the outcomes achieved in the pilot program over eighteen months resolved further that lausd closely monitor attendance taking and submittal at all school sites to accurately identify students with chronic absenteeism local district superintendents will hold all school principals accountable for attendance recording and submittal the goal for attendance submittal is every day bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm resolved further that the superintendent is directed to work with the chief financial officer to develop an incentive program that rewards schools with improved attendance by providing them with additional revenue based on increased ada andor the mailing of truancy notification letters resolved further that the board supports the opening and utilization of the attendance improvement centers aic local district superintendents will closely monitor the data to track the number and frequency of suspensions at their schools schools are to minimize the number of suspensions that are assigned to students only when suspensions are absolutely necessary schools will utilize the aics in order to prevent students from missing out on instructional time as well as lost ada revenue resolved further that the superintendent is directed to institutionalize the student recovery day and ensure it is held twice a year once each in the fall and spring semesters resolved further that the superintendent will ensure the creation of a chronic absenteeism trigger in mydata to notify parents and teachers when a child is academically at risk due to chronic absences resolved further that the superintendent shall launch an attendance campaign in collaboration with the board that will reach all district staff administrators educators and parents on the educational and fiscal impact of absenteeism lausd shall work closely with community organizations to publicize the importance of good attendance and the repercussions of absenteeism on neighborhoods and broader society and will share its renewed commitment to attendance and its connection with student success and be it finally resolved that lausd will take steps to ensure that all divisions of the lausd take responsibility for reducing chronic absences by providing outreach and service to the children and families served president garca passed the gavel to vice

evaluations must differentiate levels of instruction and performance including actual good instructionleadership our new evaluations must place strong emphasis on evidence of student learning over time offering feedback to instruction rather than feedback to simple routines our new evaluations must mean something to the employee ratings must always be useful to teachers and administrators they must result in timely specific feedback on all levels of performance be used to establish a roadmap for needed supports and to improve instructional dialogue at the school level not just provide summative judgment our new evaluation ratings must inform all employment decisions including tenure hiring for specialist or leadership positions new hires or when restructuring a school our new

performance and to make informed decisions about their childrens education board of ed special meeting minutesam ms galatzan read the following this board supports all of our employees the recent

resolutions for action ms galatzan ms garca resolution in favor of a simple majority to approve the state budget proposition whereas the los angeles unified school district lausd has over the past three years faced budget deficits that together total billion whereas the budget crisis has resulted in the firing of thousands of valued lausd employees including teachers library aids clerical staff custodians and plant managers whereas the budget crisis is in large part due to the lausd receiving drastically reduced levels of state funding bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas california is one of only three states in the nation arkansas and rhode island being the others that require a vote of the legislature to approve a budget whereas the requirement has led to a painful drawnout budget process replete with deal making horsetrading and lastminute insertions of pet projects all to the detriment of public education in california whereas the requirement has often delayed the approval of a state budget for weeks because it is so difficult to line up the necessary votes whereas these delays force lausd to adopt its own budget without knowing the amount of funding the lausd will receive from the state whereas allowing a simple majority of the legislature to approve a budget would make for both a cleaner and more efficient process and whereas proposition on the november ballot amends the state constitution to lower the vote requirement in the assembly and senate for passage of the budget to percent plus one now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of los

general and the media superintendent cortines stated that the office of the inspector general provided him and the board with a report on allegations of contracting irregularities associated with the award of construction management task orders and contracts he stated that onethird of the senior management positions in facilities are interim and at his direction in january a nationwide recruitment effort would be underway for these positions the facilities services division has approximately employees of which approximately are in maintenance and operations and funded primarily through general funds the remaining are managers designers inspectors and support staff that plan design and inspect bond funded projects less than are contract professionals working full time superintendent cortines stated that all school construction bond funded jobs will be eliminated when the bond program is complete in there were bond funded employees currently there are employees and the number is expected

are facilities exceeded amounts authorized by the board for certain contracts facilities did not fully obtain the percent discount budgeted from its construction management firms facilities negotiated an overhead and profit multiplier from contractors that was higher than reported to the board facilities permitted construction management firms to respond to a request for proposals with

regarding the issue of exceeding board authority the board of education authorized a total of million for two sets of contracts which were both brought within authorized limits after review regarding facilities not fully extracting the percent discount facilities has ensured that the district is not overpaying for labor to date million has been returned to the bond as a result of negotiations regarding the negotiated overhead and profit multiplier not accurately being reported policy direction was not adequately communicated informally into all levels of management and staff however that has been corrected regarding the consilia matter the district widely advertised and competitively procured master planning services the district not only meets the legal requirement with regard to

and assignment of professional services superintendent cortines expressed disappointment by some of the correspondence received because of its lack of specific concerns and suggested solutions he stated that without specifics he cannot act appropriately on allegations and reiterated that the day hiring freeze is to provide staff time to evaluate reports he expressed disappointment that the

that the office of the inspector general needs to not only be the districts watchdog but also a partner in identifying and implementing solutions superintendent cortines stating that existing facilities projects were delayed due to questions and concerns raised by board offices however he has requested that facilities bring the facelift projects for board action at the earliest possible

report review of special education funding and enrollment trends ms sharyn howell executive director division of special education commenced the special education funding discussion she introduced ms yumi takahashi budget director ms takahashi stated special education programs are important to the district budget because it is a billion program and declining enrollment in the total population of students poses a challenge to the special education program district enrollment has reduced approximately percent over the past eight years and special education costs have increased by approximately percent over the same amount of time ms howell stated that special education enrollment has not declined because the student population is changing due to increases in incidence of moderate to severe

actions board resolution for action waiver of board rule regarding immediate passage of the development relief and education for alien minors act of the dream act and the american dream act resolution calling for immediate passage of the development relief and education for alien minors act of the dream act and the american dream act whereas the los angeles unified school district is committed to graduating of our students whereas currently there are over undocumented students who live in the united states and are under years of age whereas each year these students are denied access to and prevented from pursuing their dreams of going to college because they do not have legal residency status bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas despite the fact that many of these children have grown up in the united states attended local schools and have demonstrated a sustained commitment to succeed in the educational system immigration laws provide no avenue for these students to become legal residents whereas undocumented immigrants throughout the united states already make substantial contributions to our economic civic and cultural life but unjustly remain vulnerable to exploitation as long as they are denied legal immigration status and access to education whereas the state supreme courts recent ruling protected the benefits of the california assembly bill for undocumented students allowing them to pay instate tuition at public colleges or universities whereas access to higher education will allow these immigrants to make even greater contributions to our society increase the educated workforce improve our economy and decrease the numbers of those forced to live in poverty whereas the development relief and education for alien minors dream act and the american dream act would remedy this situation by allowing undocumented students who have lived in the united states for at least five years and have graduated high school or received a graduate equivalency diploma to legalize their immigration status whereas undocumented students have waited many years for this legislation to become law whereas both president obama and united states secretary of education arne duncan have called upon congress to promptly pass the dream act and whereas current district legislative policies adopted by the governing board of the los angeles unified school district state that the district will support legislation to remove barriers to high school students access to higher education especially those barriers pertaining to immigration status and disabilities now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district reaffirms its support of the dream act and urges the united states congress to pass this legislation before the end of the th congress and be it finally resolved that the board instructs the superintendent and the office of legislative affairs to forward this resolution to senator dianne

relations welcomed the raben group to the board meeting mr joel packer principal the raben group briefed the board on federal education policy and funding what happened in the th congress and the outlook for the th congress mr packer stated that the th congress went from great victories to gridlock the beginning of saw the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra which provided billion for education unfortunately this was onetime funding the second session of congress brought the student aid and fiscal responsibility act which provided additional money for pell grants community colleges and minorityserving institutes of higher education the second session also produced billion for the education jobs fund and a reauthorization of the healthy and hungerfree kids act the dream act passed the house in december of but the senate failed to overcome a procedural barrier to consideration of the housepassed version there is still a chance for the senate to pass the bill before the session ends education funding went from unprecedented increases to a possible freeze in february president obama released his fiscal year budget president obama proposed a billion increase in education funding this increase provides new funding for race to the top investing in innovation and other elementary and secondary education act esea programs conversely the budget also froze important programs such as title i migrant education and education for the homeless individuals with disabilities education act idea funding was increased a modest million which maintains the current federal share of funding for special education the senate proposed a billion increase in education funding for fiscal year this proposal includes the addition of million for the early challenge learning fund to coordinate and improve preschool programs this proposal fails to fund a billion shortfall to the pell grant program on december the house passed a continuing resolution cr the cr freezes funding for all programs at fiscal year levels the cr does provide million for race to the top and pays off the pell grant shortfall bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm the senate will try to substitute an omnibus appropriations bill for the house cr this bill contains increases for title i idea after school programs investing in innovation race to the top and pell grants it will be an uphill fight to get the needed votes as republican leadership is opposed to both the cr and the omnibus bill the republican plan is to have another shortterm cr that will roll back aggregate funding to levels the elections saw major republican wins republicans now hold the largest number of house seats since democrats held on to the senate by a slim margin and will face a difficult cycle as democrats will be up for reelection compared to only republicans for the th congress republicans will control the house for the first time since with republicans picking up seats there are new members to congress in september the pledge to america was released to serve as a broad outline of the republican agenda if they took control of the house the pledge calls for a billion reduction in nonsecurity discretionary funding which could result in a cut to education funding odds are not in favor of the esea reauthorization this is not a republican priority and there will be new extremely

the first spanish literature book fair in the united states whereas lela will promote reading books in spanish in schools beginning january through april whereas percent of district students are

should have the opportunity to maintain and advance their home language through continued culturally relevant study now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified

following resolution sponsored by ms garca ms galatzan and dr vladovic in support of placing a revenue extension measure on the state ballot president garca seconded the motion which by general consent was adopted dr vladovic was absent ms martinez moved the following resolution whereas governor browns budget proposal attempts a more balanced approach to solving the states budget deficit employing both revenues and reductions and providing for an extension of temporary revenues to support programs our students need and deserve whereas over the last several years k education funding has been deeply impacted by a disproportionate share of state budget cuts whereas state and local funding for schools have been cut by more than billion or about per student in the last three years whereas the district has lost billion in state funding over the past three years whereas the loss of billion in onetime federal funding means additional cuts to school budgets statewide bd of ed special meeting minutes pm whereas to begin to reverse this downward spiral californians must retain the revenues that enable us to invest in our schools and students whereas the governors budget proposal to limit further cuts to schools in is dependent on voter approval of an extension of existing temporary tax increases whereas a ballot measure to extend temporary revenues will help prevent further cuts to schools and without this extension the california legislative analyst office reports that funding for schools would fall by as much as billion whereas the district expects our local legislators to work with the governor to protect schools from further cuts and to ensure the continued investment our students deserve and whereas the district opposes a cutsonly budget and supports a budget that is balanced with a combination of reductions and revenues now therefore be it resolved that the governing board of the los angeles unified school district supports placing a measure on the june ballot calling for a fiveyear revenue extension to protect our schools and students by making education a priority in our state new business for action continued president garca read the

the public whether these monies are being invested and spent wisely and efficiently he explained that due to the enrollment of the school system the boc would initiate an analysis on density and demographics to determine what effect those factors have on new or remodeled schools and that a charter school policy will be recommended bd of ed special meeting minutes pm he pointed out the bocs profound concern over the districts ability to provide the proper maintenance that is required to ensure that facilities reach their useful lives while maintenance and operations staff is significantly decreasing the amount of square footage that needs to be maintained is significantly increasing although the facilities services division is working on mitigating the impact by increasing efficiencies there will come a point where there will not be enough resources to perform the work required following a review of the current state of the maintenance and operations branch mo a number of challenges were identified such as funding limitations a huge area of responsibilities that includes structures million square feet acres disbursed over square miles aging facilities increasing inventory new school sites and a broad spectrum of equipment he urged the board to ensure that facilities are maintained at a proper level during these difficult economic times mr crippens thanked the men and women of mo for they are being asked to do more with less another area discussed was the bocs concern regarding the need for a professional and competent inspection program as a vital component of all properly managed construction programs as well as a specific requirement of all school construction projects in california an investigation by the boc found that certain district construction projects did not have an inspector of record ior assigned and while there were many reasons for this including a recent round of reduction in force and the need to change methodologies in the assignment of inspectors the boc has not been able to form a conclusion regarding the adequacy of the current number of inspectors engaged by the district mr crippens stressed that this is an issue that must be resolved swiftly for all construction projects must have a capable division of state architects dsa credentialed inspector while the boc is aware of the severe budget constraints reductions cannot be allowed where necessary statutory quality control and particularly safety requirements are not met mr crippens indicated that the office of the general counsel would be presenting an amendment of the bocs memorandum of understanding at the march board meeting in regards to the selection of members the proposal is to include a new taxpayer organization

relations and ms reilly answered questions from the board members after discussion and on roll call the report was adopted ayes and no ms lamotte bd of ed regular meeting minutes am board member resolution for initial announcement ms galatzan strengthening the standards based promotion policy whereas los angeles unified school district published the standardsbased promotion sbp policy in to comply with education code which became law in to outline minimum promotion criteria for students in grades the highest elementary grade and whereas kindergarten and first grade are not subject to lausds sbp rules meaning parent consent is not currently mandatory for retention in these grade levels whereas other sbp policies in large urban districts in california begin in the first grade rather than in the second grade whereas reducing retention rates is about preventing failure to begin with starting in kindergarten whereas according to the public policy institute of california retention coupled with intervention can benefit struggling students students retained in the first or second grade can significantly improve their gradelevel skills during their repeated year whereas the public policy student published a study called early grade retention and success evidence from los angeles in indicating that gains in reading skills among students retained in the first grade are significant and widely experienced whereas under the sbp policy students are expected to meet minimum identified criteria in order to move on to the next grade whereas anecdotal evidence suggests promoting students who are significantly behind gradelevel can cause those students to become aloof frustrated and ultimately atrisk this is harmful to both the student who is illprepared to advance to the next grade level as well his her classmates whereas the state requires lausd to provide direct systematic and intensive supplemental instruction to pupils in grades two through nine who have been recommended for retention or who have been retained whereas the cancellation of and summer school intersession for elementary and middle schools due to budget cuts has prevented the supplemental instruction for students who did not meet sbp criteria whereas as a result sbp policy was suspended and students have been promoted without a policy in place whereas the suspended status of the sbp and limited summer school offerings for secondary students work against lausds goal of graduation whereas research has shown that grade retention based on repetition of curriculum does not result in gains for students who have been held back whereas students who must repeat a grade need targeted intervention not simply a repeat of a grade level to address areas of weakness bd of ed regular meeting minutes am whereas interventions need to be documented to show fidelity and integrity of implementation a multipronged approach to prevention and intervention whereas students progress must be continuously assessed and instructional decisions must be based on performance data whereas the office of curriculum instruction and school support has drafted a revised sbp policy that provides for prevention and early identification of students at risk for retention outlines requirements for a multitiered approach to instruction and intervention provides parameters for what a program should look like for those students being retained establishes criteria for promotionretention and describes the parent notification and appeal process when students are not meeting promotion standards whereas the updated sbp policy is setting specific multiple measure benchmarks that will include the following indicators as appropriate to grade level periodic assessments teacher recommendation based on progress monitoring coordination of services team student success team costsst recommendations california standards test cst attendance and behavior now therefore be it resolved that the office of curriculum instruction and school support present the revised standards based promotion policy starting in july to become effective for the school year resolved further that in addition to the revised sbp policy for grades k the lausd will develop over the next six months a comprehensive secondary plan to address the failure rate in our high schools and be it finally resolved that the revised sbp policy for grades k and the new secondary plan be integrated and reflected in all of the districts guiding documents including but not exclusive of the districts performance meter the

incorporates substantive parent student and school community voices into the development of quality school plans proposed by applicant teams ms monique epps director idesign and pilot schools stated that the bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm four key aspects of the plan are that parents students and the community are informed throughout the process that their voices are heard that their voices are captured and that their voices are measured one of the first steps taken in the development of the plan was to inform all of the districts stakeholders about the psc process through a series of student and community orientation meetings in the next phase of the process data is used to measure areas of strength and areas in need of improvement for schools participating in the psc process participants will then generate and prioritize ideas and recommendations for what applicant teams should address when developing school plans participants will then have an opportunity to present

authenticity assessment and evaluation parental involvement funding and feedback budget update ms megan reilly chief financial officer provided an update on the governors enacted state budget passed on june one factor of this budget is that it is not balanced on an assumption of tax extensions but rather relies on raised revenue expectations the budget relies on deep cuts to higher education and

support of grocery workers ms martinez seconded the motion on roll call the waiver was adopted ayes no ms galatzan mr zimmer moved the following substitute motion whereas over grocery workers in southern california have been in negotiations for a new contract with vons ralphs and albertsons for over months whereas the contract covering these workers has been expired for over months whereas these grocery workers are responsible members of our communities whose work wages and benefits and participation in our neighborhoods are anchors in our communities whereas grocery workers of vons ralphs and albertsons suffered major cuts to their health care coverage during the historic week strikelockout of whereas reports show that vons ralphs and albertsons current proposal will double or nearly double health care costs for existing employees to as much as per year and the new payments could be as high as of some workers takehome pay whereas many of the parents and guardians of students in the los angeles unified school district work in the grocery industry and rely on fair working conditions and adequate healthcare for themselves and their families whereas many of these over workers and their families may be forced onto public assistance programs to obtain health care if the companies proposal to increase health care cost is implemented whereas forcing these workers into the public health care system would seriously drain our already overcrowded overextended public health care system which has already suffered funding cuts and is already stretched to its limits as a result of the current economic crisis whereas the district recognizes that the academic success of students is correlated to the health economic conditions and stability of their families bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas the corporations that own ralphs vons and albertson are some of the most profitable corporations in america having made billion in profits last year alone and having paid out million in dividends to wall street and investors and yet they pay less today for grocery workers health care here in southern california than they did ten years ago whereas failure to reach an agreement in this dispute may well result in a strike or lockout by the company and whereas a strike or lockout of this magnitude would have a serious impact in our city the fragile economy of southern california the workers themselves and the grocery industry now therefore be it resolved that the los angeles unified school district strongly endorses the efforts of both the aforementioned grocery store chains as well as the representatives of the grocery store workers to reach a just and decent contract for all parties involved in this labor dispute and urges both parties to continue their negotiations in earnest until a satisfactory agreement is reached resolved further that this resolution be forwarded by the president of the governing board of the los angeles unified school district to the ceos of the of the parent organizations of vons ralphs and albertsons and be it finally resolved that in the event of a strike or lockout district school board offices will have information available to their constituents regarding steps they can take in their respective communities to provide support to neighborhood grocery workers the following speaker

ayes no dr vladovic abstention ms lamotte president garcia assumed the chair board member resolutions for action continued ms galatzan moved the following resolution regarding strengthening the standards based promotion policy whereas the los angeles unified school district published the standards based promotion sbp policy in to comply with education code which became law in to outline minimum promotion criteria for students in grades the highest elementary grade and bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas kindergarten and first grade are not subject to the districts sbp rules meaning parent consent is mandatory for retention in these grade levels whereas other sbp plans in large urban districts in california begin in the first grade rather than in the second grade whereas according to the public policy institute of california retention coupled with intervention can benefit struggling students students retained in the first or second grade can significantly improve their gradelevel skills during their repeated year whereas the public policy student published a study called early grade retention and success evidence from los angeles in indicating that gains in reading skills among students retained in the first grade are significant and widely experienced whereas under the sbp policy students are expected to meet minimum identified criteria in order to move on to the next grade whereas anecdotal evidence suggests promoting students who are significantly behind gradelevel can cause those students to become aloof frustrated and ultimately atrisk this is harmful to both the student who is illprepared to advance to the next grade level as well his her classmates whereas the state requires the district to provide direct systematic and intensive supplemental instruction to pupils in grades two through nine who have been recommended for retention or who have been retained whereas according to the public policy institute of california percent of district students are retained before third grade whereas the cancellation of and summer school intersession for elementary and middle schools due to budget cuts has prevented the supplemental instruction for students who did not meet sbp criteria whereas as a result sbp policy was suspended and students have been promoted without a policy in place whereas the current status of the standards based promotion works against lausds goal of graduation whereas research has shown that grade retention based on repetition of curriculum does not result in gains for students who have been held back whereas students who must repeat a grade need targeted intervention for their areas of weakness whereas interventions need to be documented to show increasing frequency students progress must be continuously assessed and instructional decisions must be based on performance data whereas district staff has drafted an updated sbp policy that provides for early identification of students at risk for retention outlines requirements for tiered instruction and intervention establishes bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm criteria for promotion retention and describes the parent notification and appeal process when students are not meeting promotion standards and whereas the updated sbp policy is setting stronger benchmarks that will include the following indicators as appropriate to grade level periodic assessments teacher recommendation based on progress monitoring coordination of services team student success team cost sst recommendations california standards test cst attendance and behavior now therefore be it resolved that the los angeles unified school district develop an updated standards based promotion policy starting in july resolved further that in addition to the updated sbp policy for grades k and the district will develop a comprehensive secondary grades standards based promotion policy and implementation plan in conjunction with researchers practitioners and instructional experts within the next six months and be it finally resolved that the updated sbp policy for grades k and and the new secondary standards based promotion policy be integrated and reflected in all of the districts guiding documents including but not exclusive of the districts performance meter the revised elsel master plan and the superintendents strategic roadmap ms martinez seconded the motion superintendent deasy responded to questions from board members regarding target audience after discussion and by general consent the resolution was adopted president garca modified the order of business board member resolutions for initial announcement mr zimmer supporting lausd public school choice innovation whereas the superintendent has identified clear parameters for indistrict applicants to submit proposals under public school choice psc whereas indistrict teams working with los angeles school development institute lasdi and other partners produced excellent plans for new schools under psc and whereas los angeles unified school district charter partners submitted a total of two applications to operate focus schools and a total of applications for new schools in psc and bd of ed regular meeting minutes pm whereas intense competition for new schools in psc and diverted attention and energy from our schools that needed the most effort and enthusiasm whereas while district charter partners have made significant gains with students at schools of choice in some communities they have yet to establish a sustained track record at neighborhood boundary schools and whereas the mean academic performance index api score of the relieved schools in psc is compared to a mean api score of for focus schools and a mean api score of for charters applying for new schools now therefore be it resolved that the psc process be amended to include a preliminary indistrict competition round for new schools before the superintendent or the governing board of the los angeles unified school district considers charter applications and be it finally resolved that if neither the superintendent nor the board considers indistrict plans sufficiently excellent then indistrict plans for new schools will compete with proposals from charters or other operators mr kayser resolution on access to early childhood education special education programs whereas access to early childhood education programs has positive correlations to grade level reading and other essential proficiencies whereas highquality early childhood education has the greatest positive effect on children from lower socioeconomic status children who are at risk because of other circumstances and children with disabilities and special needs whereas access to early childhood education special education programs positively affects the rate and ratio of elementary school success for children with individualized education plans and whereas access to early childhood
